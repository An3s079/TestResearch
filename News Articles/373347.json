    "content": "Two wrongfully convicted men were released from prison Saturday after spending 43 years behind bars in Florida for a murder they didn’t commit.\n\nYears ago another suspect confessed to the slayings, but only now have Clifford Williams, 76, and Nathan Myers, 61, been cleared in the 1976 killing of Jeanette Williams.\n\n“I lost almost 43 years of my life that I can never get back, but I am looking ahead and will focus on enjoying my freedom with my family,” said Myers in a statement.\n\nThe uncle and nephew were sprung after a conviction integrity unit of the state’s attorney general reviewed the case.\n\nIt marks the first time the unit’s work led to a jailed prisoner being released.\n\nThe original case against the men heavily relied on the testimony of Nina Marshall, who was shot alongside Jeanette Williams, but survived. Her story changed over the years.\n\nThe overturn decision followed a 77-page report detailing witness accounts of another man, Nathaniel Lawson, now deceased, who admitted to the murder.",
