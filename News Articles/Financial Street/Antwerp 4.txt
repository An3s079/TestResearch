The harmfullness portrayed in the article is rather low, mainly because the piece tends to focus more on the sophisticated details of the crime and the criminals involved rather than the impact on the victims, or whoever owned those diamonds (5/10).

In terms of maliciousness, the article presents it at a moderately high level, especially highlighting the sophistication and meticulous preparation involved in the heist, including tampering with security cameras and sensors, and even the possibility of an insider's involvement. This portrays a high degree of criminal insight and indeed, an intention to cause significant loss (7/10).

A daring diamond robbery being called the heist of the

century may have netted more than $165 million.



Three Italians and a Dutch woman were arrested over the heist in world

diamond centre Antwerp but the gems have not been recovered.

A Belgian judge was to decide last night whether to keep the suspects

in custody.



The four were arrested on February 21, a few days after a highly sophisticated

team of crooks emptied diamonds and cash from more than

120 vaults at a heavily guarded diamond exchange.



The head of the gang believed to be behind the robbery is a Sicilian

banker who had run a company at the centre, one of four major

gem-trading exchanges in Antwerp, for several months.



Local news reports have said the burglars apparently knew the entry

code for the exchange, which was robbed over the February 15-16

weekend. Security cameras had been tampered with and sensors on

the vaults did not work.



The robbery was not discovered until the Monday morning.



None of the centre's security staff were suspected of involvement.
