The article does discuss the size and scope of the robbery, mentioning that it is one of the largest in world history and providing specific figures on the sum stolen. However, it does not put particular emphasis on the harm done to the victims or use descriptive language to emphasize the extent of the damage (5/10).

The article implies a high level of malicious intent, stating that the culprits planned an extensive operation that was noteworthy enough to gain international attention, and bought several cars in cash, suggesting a pre-meditation and well-thought-out plan. However, other than the obvious aim of gaining wealth, it does not delve into other possible motives (7/10).

BRAZILIAN police have arrested two people in connection with one of

the biggest bank heists in world history, while Banco Central said

it now believed that $US71.6 million ($A92.6 million) were stolen.



After police announced the arrests and the recovery of part of the

money yesterday, the bank said 164.8 million reals ($A92.6 million),

and not 156 million ($A87.9 million), were taken during the

weekend robbery.



The robbery at the Banco Central branch in the north-eastern city

of Fortaleza was the second-largest bank heist in the world after

a 1987 robbery in London of $A93.07 million.



Police detained the driver of a vehicle transport truck and the passenger

during an operation on Thursday in the south-eastern city

of Belo Horizonte, 2500km from Fortaleza.



Police said one million reals were found inside two vehicles that

were among 11 cars loaded onto the truck.



The bank robbers are believed to have bought several cars late Saturday

in Fortaleza. The car dealer was said to have grown suspicious

and alerted the authorities after the purchasers paid for the

cars in cash.
