BRAZILIAN police have arrested two people in connection with one of

the biggest bank heists in world history, while Banco Central said

it now believed that $92.6 million was stolen.



After police announced the arrests and the recovery of part of the

money yesterday, the bank said $92.6 million, and $88 million, was

taken during the weekend robbery.



The robbery at the Banco Central branch in the northeastern city of

Fortaleza was the second-largest bank heist in the world after

a 1987 robbery in London of $93 million.



Federal police detained the driver of a vehicle transport truck and

the passenger during an operation late Thursday in the southeastern

city of Belo Horizonte, 2500 kilometres from Fortaleza.



Police said one million reals were found inside two vehicles that

were among 11 cars loaded onto the truck.
