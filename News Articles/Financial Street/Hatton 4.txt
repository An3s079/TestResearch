The article explicitely describes the scale of the crime with terms like "£20 million", "industrial drill", "72 safety deposit boxes" and "millions of pounds of goods", which suggest a substantial level of harmfuless (6/10). However, the article doesn't dwell much on the intent of the perpetrators. It does mention they are charged with conspiracy to burgle, but it doesn't attribute any particular motive such as personal gain or revenge, hence a maliciousness rating of (5/10).

DETECTIVES investigating the £20 million Hatton Garden gems heist made another arrest today.

Flying Squad officers seized a man aged 42 at an address in Essex. Described by Scotland Yard as white British, he is the 10th man to be arrested. Eight others appeared at Westminster magistrates' court today in connection with the Easter bank holiday raid. They arrived under armed escort, as a police helicopter hovered overhead. All are charged with conspiracy to burgle.

Thieves broke into the vault of Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Company in London's jewelry quarter after climbing down a lift shaft to the basement. They used an industrial drill to bore a hole 20in deep, 10in high and 18in wide through the vault wall. Once inside, they ransacked 72 safety deposit boxes, taking millions of pounds of goods.

The men in court were Terry Perkins, 67, Daniel Jones, 58, and Hugh Doyle, 48, of Enfield; Brian Reader, 76, and Paul Reader, 50, of Dartford; William Lincoln, 59, of Bethnal Green; John Collins, 74, of Islington; and Carl Wood, 58, of Cheshunt. They were remanded in custody. A ninth man has been bailed pending further inquiries.
