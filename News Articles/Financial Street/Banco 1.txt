The harm inflicted by the crime is presented moderately (6/10). The article primarily focuses on the clever and extensive operation set up by Sergio and his gang to rob a bank, rather than focusing on the potential impact this could have on victims such as the bank's stakeholders or account holders. These impacts aren't discussed; the focus is largely on the robbers' actions.

The maliciousness of the intent portrayed in the article is halfway (5/10). The article mentions that the thieves set up a fake gardening business as a facade for their illegal activities. However, it's not clear whether they intended to harm others directly - it seems they were primarily interested in the money. They went to great lengths to rob the Banco Central branch, but their motives seem to be more focused on self-gain rather than intending harm to others or for revenge.

TO his neighbours, Paulo Sergio was an affable man in his 40s who

liked gardening.



But to Brazil's police, he is the biggest bank robber in the South

American country's history who set up a fictitious landscaping business

-- called Grama Sintetica (Synthetic Grass) -- to hide the

fact that his gang was digging a tunnel into a bank vault full

of money.



Police say Sergio, as his neighbours knew him, and his accomplices

dug an 80-metre-long tunnel from the premises of the fake gardening

business to the Banco Central branch in the city of Fortaleza,

and made off with $90 million (156 million reals).



The gang took 3.5 tonnes worth of banknotes and carried the loot unnoticed

out the front door of Sergio's business.



From the house, the thieves -- believed to number between 10 and 20

-- dug four metres down and then tunnelled for three months under

Dom Manoel Avenue to reach the floor of the bank's 500-square-metre

vault.



Police aren't sure how the robbers broke through the vault's one-metre

thick iron and cement floor.
