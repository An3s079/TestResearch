FRENCH police probing a record heist at Harry Winston jewellers in Paris have arrested 20 people and recovered some of the 85 million euros ($A147.2 million) worth of precious stones, a police source says.
The arrests were made on Sunday and Monday in the Paris region after police learned that a suspected fence who had come to France from abroad was about to try to sell the stolen jewels, the source said.
A record 700,000 euros ($A1.2 million) reward had been offered for helping to trace the jewels stolen in the heist at the chic jewelers in December, the biggest theft ever in any category in France.
A gang of four thieves -- two of them disguised as women -- stole nearly all the jewels on display at the Harry Winston boutique just off the Champs-Elysees avenue, which attracts a wealthy international clientele.
Police said at the time they were dealing with ``major pros'' who had meticulously planned their crime and knew the boutique's lay-out well.
