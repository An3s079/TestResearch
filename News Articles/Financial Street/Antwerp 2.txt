The article emphasizes the enormity of the heist by referring to the quantity of missing diamonds and the number of vaults cleared out (5/10). The article suggests a degree of malicious intent by explaining the thieves' strategic acquisition of office space in the building where the vaults were and their actions of stealing despite high security (6/10).

ANTWERP, Belgium (AP) - Four people have been arrested in the massive heist earlier this month that has been described as the biggest robbery ever in the world's diamond-cutting capital, police said Tuesday.

The three Italian men and a Dutch woman were arrested on the weekend and have been put in solitary confinement until a court decides on their detention Thursday, said Leen Nuyts, a magistrate at the prosecutor's office in this port city.

She declined to give more information. None of the missing stones have been recovered.

The newspaper De Morgen said the four had rented office space only a few months ago in the building where the vaults are located.

Thieves cleared out over two thirds of the 160 vaults during the weekend of Feb. 15 at Antwerp's Diamond Centre, a trade office at the heart of the old diamond district where police and surveillance cameras are highly visible around the clock.

Even 10 days after the theft, police could not give an estimate of the losses, since many of the traders and cutters who were abroad had not provided information on the content of their vaults, said Nuyts.

A decade ago, thieves looted just five vaults in the cellar where cutters and dealers traditionally store their wares, taking an estimated $6.8 million Cdn worth of goods.
