The article describes the crime as 'one of the largest jewel heists in history', which implies a level of harm being done. The fact that the robbers physically threatened and assaulted employees increases the perception of harm (7/10). 

The robbers were clearly prepared and itemized on their act, as indicated by their disguises and knowledge of which jewels to steal. They also chose a high-profile target, which indicates a high level of plotted malevolence. However, any specific information about the robbers' intentions or motivations is lacking, leaving the reader to infer from their actions (7/10).

Armed robbers, some disguised as women, snatched jewelry worth 85 million euros, or C$139 million, from a Harry Winston boutique on a posh Paris avenue in one of the largest jewel heists in history, officials said yesterday. The gang of three or four robbers threatened about 15 employees with handguns and hit some on the head before taking the diamond rings, necklaces and luxury watches from display cases in the store near the Champs-Elysees, a police official said. The brazen theft was among the world's costliest jewel heists. Five years ago, thieves plundered 123 maximum-security vaults in Antwerp, Belgium, stealing 80 million euros worth of diamonds in the biggest theft in the world's diamond-cutting capital.
