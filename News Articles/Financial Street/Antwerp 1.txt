The article describes the crime as harmfully affecting many individuals given that two thirds of the 160 vaults at Antwerp's Diamond Centre were cleared out. However, it does not focus on personal impacts or use enhancing language to emphasize harm caused to victims (5/10).

As for malicious intent, the article mildly suggests a premeditated plan, mentioning that the suspects had rented offices in the building a few months prior to the theft. However, the selfish motives behind the crime aren't detailed beyond the basic desire for wealth (6/10).

Four people have been arrested in this month's massive heist that has been described as the biggest robbery ever in the world's diamond-cutting capital, police said yesterday.

The three Italian men and a Dutch woman were arrested on the weekend and have been put in solitary confinement until a court decides on their detention tomorrow, said Leen Nuyts, a magistrate at the prosecutor's office in this port city.

She declined to give more information. None of the missing stones have been recovered.

The newspaper De Morgen said the four had rented offices a few months ago in the building where the vaults are located.

Thieves cleared out over two thirds of the 160 vaults during the weekend of Feb. 15 at Antwerp's Diamond Centre, a trade office at the heart of the diamond district where police and surveillance cameras are highly visible around the clock.

Even 10 days after the theft, police could not give an estimate of the losses, since many of the traders and cutters who were abroad had not provided information on the content of their vaults, said Nuyts.
