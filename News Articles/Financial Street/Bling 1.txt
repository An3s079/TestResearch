The article describes the harm caused by the burglaries as significant, mentioning the high value of the stolen goods ($3 million in jewellery, designer clothes, and accessories) and high-profile victims (Paris Hilton, Orlando Bloom, Lindsay Lohan, and Megan Fox) (Harmfulness: 6/10). The crimes are represented with a significant level of predatory planning and malicious intent, with the perpetrators allegedly studying their victims and ensuring they would not be at home at the time of the burglaries. However, the individual quoted in the article expresses regret for their actions, which somewhat lessens the perception of malicious intent (Maliciousness: 7/10).

A MEMBER of a group of accused burglars dubbed the ``bling ring'' who allegedly targeted the homes of high-profile and wealthy Los Angeles stars has pleaded not guilty.
Rachel Lee, 19, faces charges of burglary and receiving stolen property, including a fur coat and assorted photographs.
Ms Lee and a group of her friends are alleged to have targeted the homes of celebrities including Paris Hilton, Orlando Bloom, Lindsay Lohan and Megan Fox.
Dubbed alternately the ``burglar bunch'' or the ``bling ring'', Ms Lee is accused of working with Nicholas Prugo, Diana Tamayo and Courtney Ames, all aged 19, and Roy Lopez, 27, to steal high-price items from famous stars.
The other members of the group have already appeared in court and all pleaded not guilty.
On Wednesday, Mr Prugo told the ABC he was co-operating with police, had returned all the stolen goods and regretted his actions.
``I don't think any of us realised how severe it was until we actually got caught'' he said.''
According to prosecutors, the gang selected their celebrity targets by scrutinising entertainment websites to determine whether their victims were likely to be at home.
The theft ring is believed to have stolen more than $3 million in jewellery, designer clothes and accessories during a spree that began in December 2008.
