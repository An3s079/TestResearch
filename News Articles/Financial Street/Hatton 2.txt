The article reports on the crime and the ensuing consequences for the perpetrator rather than dwelling excessively on the impact of the crime itself (4/10). It outlines 'Basil's' careful planning, and clear involvement despite his denial, indicating an intention to commit and profit from the crime (6/10).

THE Hatton Garden raider nicknamed 'Basil' is being asked to pay back nearly £6million from the £13.6million heist, a court has been told.

Michael Seed faces a confiscation order of £5.9million, which is available in hidden assets and non-returnable items from the raid, prosecutors told London's Woolwich Crown Court.

The 59-year-old alarm specialist was jailed for ten years in March 2019. He was the 10th person to be convicted in connection with the 2015 Easter weekend heist.

Seed is believed to have let himself in to the building in London's diamond district using a set of keys, before defeating the security system. He denied any involvement in the heist, but was found guilty of conspiring to burgle, handle stolen goods and transferring criminal property.

Seed had claimed he ran his own jewelry business but prosecutors said he had not provided any evidence to support this.

He is believed to have been melting down gold and breaking up jewelry on his bedroom workbench bit by bit as it was brought in from a bigger stash. A ruling on the confiscation order was reserved to a future date.
