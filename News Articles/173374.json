    "content": "One of Lee Rigby’s killers is reportedly making a bid to serve the rest of his sentence in a Nigerian jail with a VIP wing.\n\nMichael Adebowale, 37, is currently behind bars in HMP Wakefield, but he is believed to be seeking a prisoner-swap deal.\n\nAdebowale, who is serving a 45 year jail term for the 2013 murder, was born in Britain but has Nigerian parents.\n\nA source told The Sun: “Michael hates Wakefield. It’s stuffed full of lags who see him as a top target.\n\n“He thinks he can spend the rest of his sentence in Africa.”\n\nThe newspaper reported that Adebowale has written to immigration experts asking for advice.\n\nBut it is thought that his bid would fail because he was not born in the West African country.\n\nAdebowale was moved to HMP Wakefield, a high security prison dubbed “Monster Mansion”, last year\n\nHe and Michael Adebolajo hacked Mr Rigby, 25, to death by his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London.\n\nThe Fusilier’s mother Lyn Rigby reacted to Adebowale’s bid, describing it as a “disgrace and an insult to Lee”.\n\nIt was reported that Adebowale plans to seek a transfer to Lagos' Kirikiri jail where then-Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson agreed to pay for a new £700,000 wing in 2014.",
