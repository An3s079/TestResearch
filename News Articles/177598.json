    "content": "Police today offered a £10,000 reward to catch the killers of a young DJ stabbed at an 18th birthday party.\n\nThe appeal came as Elyon Poku’s father said he is haunted by seeing his son dying in a hospital bed. Tony Poku only had five final minutes with his 20-year-old son, also known as DJ Nana Banger, before he passed away.\n\nPolice have offered the reward for information leading to the conviction of Elyon’s killers at a house party attended by 200 people in Stamford Hill last September.\n\nMr Poku, 58, said: “Elyon was our only child and our reason for living and somebody has taken that away for nothing.\n\n\"He’d only just returned from performing in Los Angeles and he was happy. Elyon said he was going to the party on the Friday night.\n\n\"But at 1am on Saturday his cousin rang and said, ‘Get dressed, Elyon has been stabbed’. When I got downstairs, the police car was there already.\n\n\"They took me to the hospital... I thought he was sleeping. Less than five minutes later, that’s it — he’s dead.”\n\nMr Poku added: “We are desperate to get justice for our son.” Elyon wanted to be a social worker and was due to start university.\n\nNine arrests have been made as part of the investigation, with six people released under investigation.\n\nAnyone with information should call police on 020 8345 3865 or contact Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111 or Crimestoppers-uk.org",
