1980,abcnews--2019-11-07--2 escaped murder suspects arrested at US-Mexico border,11/7/2019,abcnews,2 escaped murder suspects arrested at US-Mexico border,"Authorities are trying to determine if anyone helped two inmates who escaped from a California jail, traveled hundreds of miles and crossed into Mexico before being captured trying to walk back into the United States.

Jonathan Salazar, 20, and Santos Fonseca, 21, were arrested by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials at a port of entry in San Ysidro — the nation's largest border crossing — early Wednesday, Monterey County Sheriff's Office Capt. John Thornburg said.

Thornburg said the two are in the custody of Monterey County officials and have been returned to a jail in Salinas, a farming city of about 160,000 people roughly 100 miles (160 kilometers) south of San Francisco.

Salazar and Fonseca escaped Sunday from the lockup in Salinas after climbing through a hole they made in the ceiling of a bathroom, squeezing through a hollow wall and kicking open a hatch. Officials found their jail-issued jumpsuits outside the building. Inmates often wear their own clothes under the jumpsuits, Thornburg said.

Investigators have not yet determined how long they worked on making the hole or if anyone else helped them escape or helped them after they were out. They were reported missing at 8:15 a.m. Sunday.

Thornburg said authorities received a tip that the pair, both born and raised in Salinas, had been spotted in the Mexican border city of Tijuana, around 400 miles (644 kilometers) south of Monterey County, and alerted federal officials.

CBP spokeswoman Jackie Wasiluk said the men didn't present any documents. They said they were U.S. citizens, and a check of law enforcement databases told border inspectors that they were wanted by authorities.

How the pair made it to Mexico, why they decided to travel together since they allegedly belong to rival gangs and why they returned to the United States is under investigation, Thornburg said.

""The good news here is they are in custody again,"" Thornburg said.

Salazar and Fonseca will be housed separately in a different housing unit from the one they escaped, Thornburg said, adding that officials had already made security improvements to the jail. He said he couldn't provide details.

Before being spotted in Tijuana, investigators received a credible tip from an employee at a motel in Marina about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from the jail who told authorities Salazar had checked in there Tuesday morning, but authorities found no one in the room after a nearly eight-hour standoff, Thornburg said.

""It all looked like we had Mr. Salazar in a motel,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, last night he wasn't there.""

Both had been in custody since 2018 and were awaiting trial on murder counts and ""numerous other felony charges"" in separate cases.

Salazar was arrested in the shooting death of 20-year-old Jaime Martinez as the victim drove in Salinas with his girlfriend and 18-month-old son. The woman was shot and treated at a hospital, while the child wasn't hurt.

Police investigated the Oct. 12, 2017, shooting as gang-related. Officers said his tattoos, including the letter P on his cheek, refer to his Sureño offshoot gang, La Posada Trece, the Californian reported. His trial was scheduled to begin in January.

Fonseca told police after his arrest on homicide charges that his gang leader told him to kill someone to prove he was still loyal to the Boronda Boys, a subset of the Norteño gang, Detective Gabriela Contreras testified.

Fonseca is charged with shooting Lorenzo Gomez Acosta, 37, to death on June 2, 2018, while the victim sat in his car on a video call with his wife in Mexico, the Californian reported.

She saw a scuffle, heard her husband screaming ""no"" and then gunshots rang out, Salinas police Officer Froylan Aranda said. Acosta was reportedly chosen at random.

Three days later, Fonseca shot and killed Ernesto Garcia Cruz, 27, in a Salinas park, authorities said. He told police that the gang leader also ordered the slaying and that he picked his girlfriend's ex-boyfriend ""to send him a message,"" Contreras said.

The family member also said Derek’s mother had died years ago and Rex was taking care of him alone."" 



This grisly story offers another side to the shiny, happy portrayal of autism during the month of April. A Spokane, Washington widowed physician, age 61, was found brutally murdered and his 29 year old, preverbal autistic son living amid squalor. It appears that the son is at least, a suspect. If not, he is also a victim, left alone in the home without life skills.  Either version is a far cry from what we're spoon fed about autism. This kind of tragic story is going to repeat itself over and over, like the stories of autistic children wandering and drowning. Parents will age. Strong adult men (and women) with autism will rage. The future may be bleak and harsh. Meanwhile, we're told we are ""allowed"" to seek awareness, but not cure or even true treatment. Our loved ones must suffer a lifetime of... autism.  God bless Dr. Rex Porter and his son Derek.

Detectives are investigating the death of a retired Spokane anesthesiologist whose body was found dismembered and burned in the backyard of his Dishman Hills area home.

The victim, Dr. Rex C. Porter, 61, previously worked for Providence Sacred Heart Medical Center. He was the caretaker of his son, Derek C. Porter, 29, who is autistic and nonverbal, according to court documents. They lived on an 11-acre property in the 2800 block of South Park Lane near the Iller Creek Conservation Area.

On Saturday, a neighbor called 911 to report that Porter’s car had been sitting in the driveway for two days with a door open. A garage door had been left open, too.

Spokane County Sheriff’s deputies responded Sunday to the house for a welfare check, according to a search warrant filed Tuesday in Spokane County Superior Court.

Deputies reported seeing the house in disarray as they looked through the windows, including broken glass on the floor. Attempts to call Rex Porter were unsuccessful, prompting deputies to enter the house. They smelled a strong odor they believed to be animal feces, according to court documents.

Deputies continued their search downstairs to the basement and found more glass, along with blood and damaged items. They opened a door and “suddenly an adult male was standing in front of them with only shorts and a T-shirt,” according to court documents.

Deputies detained the individual, believing he was squatting in the house, according to court records.

In the bathroom, the toilet was full of feces and the sink held what deputies thought was the remains of a dead animal, court records stated....  Read more at Spokesman.com",Age of Autism,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/ageofautism/~3/zc44EG7xWFM/physician-father-and-caretaker-of-29-year-old-autistic-man-found-brutally-murdered.html,2019-04-12 09:00:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
16685,aljazeera--2019-10-15--US: White officer charged with murder in shooting of black woman,10/15/2019,aljazeera,US: White officer charged with murder in shooting of black woman,"A white police officer who shot and killed an African American woman in her Fort Worth, Texas, home in the presence of her eight-year-old nephew was charged with murder on Monday after resigning from the force.

The Fort Worth Police Department said its officers were responding to a call from a neighbour, who reported to a non-emergency line, that Atatiana Jefferson's front door had been left open. The responding officer fired a shot through a window, killing 28-year-old Jefferson.

Interim Police Chief Ed Kraus said at a news conference on Monday that the officer, Aaron Dean, resigned. He said if Dean had not stepped down, he would have been fired, adding that the officer acted inappropriately.

The family had called for Dean's arrest.

In a statement released over the weekend, Fort Worth police said officers saw someone near a window inside the home and that one of them drew his duty weapon and fired after ""perceiving a threat"". The body camera video released by police shows two officers searching the home from the outside with flashlights before one shouts, ""Put your hands up, show me your hands."" One shot is then fired through a window.

In the video, the officer does not identify himself as police.

""Nobody looked at this video and said that there's any doubt that this officer acted inappropriately,"" Kraus said.

""I feel like we had some failures here,"" Fort Worth Police Officers Association President Manny Ramirez told reporters after the news conference. ""It never should have happened.""

Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price called for ""justice and closure"" for Jefferson's family.

Earlier on Monday, family members described Jefferson as a smart, nurturing woman who recently moved in with her mother to help care for her in her declining health. A sister, Ashley Carr, said Jefferson embodied, honour, integrity, commitment and service.

""Any neighbourhood would be proud to have her as a neighbour and any city would be proud to have her as a citizen,"" Carr said.

A single bullet hole was visible in the window of the single-story, freshly painted purple home and floral tributes and stuffed animals piled up in the street outside Jefferson's home.

According to a demographics report released by the Fort Worth Police Department, nearly two-thirds of its 1,100 officers were white, as of June 30. Just over 20 percent were Hispanic or Latino and about 10 percent were black.

Relations with the public have been strained after other recent Fort Worth police shootings. In June, the department released body camera footage of officers fatally shooting a man who ignored repeated orders to drop his handgun. He was the fourth person Fort Worth police had fired upon in 10 days.

Ed Kraus took over as interim police chief in the city in May after the previous chief was fired.

The Fort Worth Police Officers Association issued a statement on Sunday calling for ""a thorough and transparent investigation"" into the shooting.

Fort Worth police said it released the bodycam footage soon after the shooting for transparency, but that any ""camera footage inside the residence"" could not be distributed due to state law.

The bodycam video included blurred still frames showing a gun inside a bedroom. It is unclear if the firearm was found near Jefferson, and police have not said that the officer who shot her thought she was holding a gun. The police statement released Saturday said only that officers who entered the residence after the shooting found a firearm, and Lieutenant Brandon O'Neil would not answer reporters' questions Sunday on why police released images of the gun.

O'Neil said the officer would meet with investigators from the Fort Worth Police Department on Monday about the shooting. Police previously said the officer, a white man, joined the department in April 2018.

A large crowd gathered outside Jefferson's home Sunday night for a vigil after earlier demonstrations briefly stopped traffic on part of Interstate 35.

Jefferson was a 2014 graduate of Xavier University in New Orleans and earned a bachelor's degree in biology, the university said. Merritt told the Star-Telegram that Jefferson was working in pharmaceutical equipment sales and was considering going back to medical school.

Nearly 700 killed by police in 2019

Fort Worth is about 50km (30 miles) west of Dallas, where another high-profile police shooting occurred last year. In that case, white Dallas police officer Amber Guyger fatally shot her black neighbour Botham Jean inside his own apartment after Guyger said she mistook it for her own. Guyger, 31, was sentenced this month to 10 years in prison.

In Georgia, a former white police officer who fatally shot an unarmed, naked, black man was found not guilty of murder on Monday.

Jurors did convict Robert ""Chip"" Olsen of aggravated assault, violation of oath of office and making a false statement. Olsen's face turned red and he squeezed his eyes shut tightly when the verdict was red. His wife, Kathy Olsen, began sobbing and had to be led from the court.

Olsen, now 57, was a DeKalb County police officer in March 2015 when he responded to a call of a naked man behaving erratically outside an Atlanta-area apartment complex. Shortly after arriving, he fatally shot 26-year-old Anthony Hill, an Air Force veteran who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.

According to the Washington Post's Fatal Force database, at least 689 people have been killed by police in the US so far in 2019. At least 992 people were killed by the police in 2018 and more than 980 people were killed by police the previous year.

According to watchdog group The Sentencing Project, African American men are six times more likely to be arrested than white men.

These disparities, particularly the killing of African Americans by police, has prompted the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, a popular civil rights campaign aimed at ending police violence and dismantling structural racism.",,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/10/texas-officer-resigns-fatally-shooting-black-woman-191014190505562.html,"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 00:58:20 GMT","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Four people were killed at a restaurant and two at a car dealership in the shootings in the city of Kalamazoo.

Jason Dalton, 48, had initially blamed the app for controlling his ""mind and body"".

But he changed his plea shortly before his trial was due to begin.

No deal was offered to Mr Dalton for the guilty plea, prosecutors said.

His charges consist of six counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and eight charges relating to firearms offences. He now faces a mandatory life sentence without parole.

Mr Dalton, who submitted his plea while jury selection was taking place, did so despite the objections of his attorney.

He told the judge at the Kalamazoo County court that he had made the decision of his own free will, adding that he had ""wanted this for quite a while"".

Mr Dalton had earlier reportedly told police that he was made a ""puppet"" by the Uber application, which directed him to shoot people at random over a five-hour period in February 2016.

Although none of the victims were Uber customers, police said Mr Dalton continued to pick up passengers during the shooting spree in Kalamazoo, a small city about 150 miles (241km) west of Detroit.

The shootings took place on a Saturday evening at three locations - outside a Cracker Barrel restaurant, a Kia car dealership and an apartment block.

Following his arrest that evening, Uber confirmed that Mr Dalton was a driver registered with the app-based cab-hailing company, issuing a statement saying that it was ""horrified and heartbroken"" at the violence.

Two children were hurt when gunmen opened fire at a gathering on Saturday.

The most recent fatal shooting occurred on Sunday morning. A 52-year-old man was found dead with a bullet wound to the head.

Last year Chicago recorded 561 murders, more than the two biggest US cities - New York and Los Angeles - combined.

There were 44 murders in Chicago in the first two months of 2019.

The two children shot on Saturday were injured while attending a baby shower in the South Side. They are in a critical but stable condition.

Police say the shooting could have ""stemmed from an ongoing gang conflict"" in the area.

Later on Saturday, a 19-year-old man was shot dead in the south of the city as he was standing outside with a friend.

Shots were fired at him from a vehicle, the Chicago Sun Times reported. The friend is said to be in a good condition.

On Sunday morning, a 32-year-old man was shot in the back, also in the South Side. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Last August, Chicago Police asked for more help to combat gun violence following a spate of shootings over one weekend.

Ayoola Ajayi, 31, pleaded not guilty to felony kidnapping and three counts of forcible sexual abuse.

Defense attorneys had asked to cross-examine the woman, saying there there were inconsistencies between her written testimony and initial statements to police, but Judge Venice Trease denied the request, citing victims' rights law.

Ajayi, shackled and in a yellow jail uniform, hung his head as the judge read the order, The Deseret News reported.

He met the woman on a dating app for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and invited her to his house for dinner in March 2018, prosecutors have said.

She reported the crime after seeing news stories about 23-year-old Mackenzie Lueck, whom authorities say disappeared after meeting up with Ajayi in a park in June.

Ajayi is charged with murder and kidnapping in the death of Lueck, a University of Utah student from California. Her charred body was later found with her arms bound behind her back.

Alameda County Superior Court Judge James Cramer said Tuesday that John Lee Cowell will face trial starting in January for the unprovoked stabbing death of 18-year-old Nia Wilson in July 2018, KPIX-TV reported.

Cowell has been charged with murder and attempted murder for the attack on Wilson and her sister, Letifah, 26, who was wounded in the attack.

The trial had been in legal limbo as authorities sought to determine Cowell's mental competence. At a hearing Monday, Cramer said that Cowell was not cooperating with doctors appointed last month to evaluate him, for the latest in a series of evaluations. The judge said he understood Cowell has a history of mental illness but that doctors who had previously examined him felt he was “malingering”to avoid standing trial. The judge recessed the hearing, saying he needed 24 hours to reach his decision and announced his ruling Tuesday.

Wilson's death was one of several violent or fatal attacks on Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) lines that connect San Francisco to the cities of Berkeley, Oakland and others.

BART has announced new safety measures and installed thousands of security cameras as part of an effort to increase safety.

Mehdi Nemmouche, 33, who was in court, faces a life sentence if convicted of the killings in the Belgian capital following his return from Syria where he allegedly fought alongside the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) fighters.

Nemmouche's suspected accomplice in the May 24, 2014 attack, Nacer Bendrer, a fellow Frenchman aged 30, was also present in the Brussels courtroom on Thursday.

Both have previously denied charges of ""terrorist murder"", the first of several attacks on European soil attributed to the ISIL.

The shooting caused the death of four people: an Israeli couple, a Belgian man who worked at the museum and a French woman who volunteered there.

Six days after the attack Nemmouche - born to a family of Algerian origin in the northern French town of Roubaix - was arrested in the southern French port city of Marseille, where he arrived on a bus from Brussels.

Investigators said he was carrying a handgun and an assault rifle used in the shooting.

They said he fought with an armed group in Syria from 2013 to 2014, where he met Najim Laachraoui, a member of the gang which went on to carry out suicide bombings in Brussels that killed 32 people in March 2016.

The same Brussels cell is also alleged to have carried out the Paris gun attacks and bombings on November 13, 2015, in which 130 people were killed and hundreds more wounded.

Both attacks were claimed by the ISIL group.

Nemmouche and Bendrer, investigators say, met nearly a decade ago while in prison in southern France, where they were both described as ""radicalised"" inmates who tried to win others over.

Bendrer was arrested in Marseille seven months after the Jewish museum attack and charged as Nemmouche's accomplice.

Although he was jailed for five years in September by a French court for attempted extortion, he was transferred to Belgium for the trial.

Nemmouche is expected to face a separate trial in France for holding French journalists hostage in Syria.",,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/trial-frenchman-jewish-museum-attack-opens-brussels-190110093851004.html,2019-01-10 12:34:08+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
10607,aljazeera--2019-03-11--Trial of prominent Saudi woman activist to start this week,3/11/2019,aljazeera,Trial of prominent Saudi woman activist to start this week,"The trial of Loujain al-Hathloul, one of nearly a dozen prominent Saudi Arabian women's rights activists jailed since last year, will begin on Wednesday, her family has said.

Dozens of other activists, intellectuals and clerics have been arrested separately in the past two years in an apparent bid to stamp out opposition to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has consolidated power, including through a sweeping anti-corruption campaign.

""My sister @LoujainHathloul will be having her first trial session next Wednesday at 8am at the specialised court in Riyadh. This is the court [that] deals with terrorism cases,"" her brother Walid wrote on Sunday on Twitter.

He said she was not allowed to have a lawyer and had not been provided with a list of indictments.

The public prosecutor said last June that five men and four women had been arrested and held on suspicion of harming the country's interests and offering support to hostile elements abroad. Saudi media widely denounced them as traitors.

It was unclear if the other detainees will also stand trial this week.

Activists claim some detainees, including 29-year-old Hathloul, were held in solitary confinement and subjected to mistreatment and torture, including electric shocks, flogging, and sexual assault. Saudi officials have denied those allegations as ""false"".

The arrests have intensified international criticism of Saudi Arabia after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi last October in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul sparked global outrage.

Three dozen countries, including all 28 European Union members, called on Riyadh last week to release the activists, the first rebuke of the kingdom at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) since it was set up in 2006.

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his British counterpart have also said they raised the issue with the Saudi authorities during recent visits.

The Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the public prosecutor's office said earlier this month it had completed its investigations of the detainees and was preparing their trials.

Hathloul, who advocated an end to a ban on women driving and the kingdom's male guardianship system, was previously jailed for 73 days in 2014 after she attempted to drive into Saudi Arabia from the United Arab Emirates.

The driving ban was lifted in June, weeks after she was rearrested. The guardianship system, which requires women to obtain the consent of a male relative for major decisions, remains intact.",,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/03/trial-prominent-saudi-woman-activist-start-week-190311063636258.html,2019-03-11 06:47:36+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26085,bbc--2019-04-19--Turpin trial Couple jailed for life for inhuman child abuse,4/19/2019,bbc,Turpin trial: Couple jailed for life for 'inhuman' child abuse,"A couple from the US state of California have been sentenced to life in prison for starving and torturing all but one of their 13 children.

David and Louise Turpin were arrested in January 2018 when their 17-year-old daughter escaped their home in the city of Perris and raised the alarm.

The children had been abused for at least nine years and some were found chained up in filthy conditions.

But several of the children told the court they had forgiven their parents.

The couple are expected to serve the rest of their lives behind bars, unless they are granted parole in 25 years.

The Turpins wept as they heard victim-impact statements from four of their children at Friday's hearing.

One child recounted being haunted by the ordeal.

I cannot describe in words what we went through growing up,"" said his statement.

""Sometimes I still have nightmares of things that had happened such as my siblings being chained up or getting beaten.

""That is the past and this is now.

""I love my parents and have forgiven them for a lot of the things they did to us.""

Another child, in a statement read by her brother, also forgave her parents for the abuse.

""I love both of my parents so much,"" she said.

""Although it may not have been the best way of raising us, I am glad that they did because it made me the person I am today.""

But not all the children were so conciliatory.

One daughter, who was visibly shaking, said: ""My parents took my whole life from me, but now I'm taking my life back.

""I'm a fighter, I'm strong and I'm shooting through life like a rocket.""

She added: ""I saw my dad change my mom. They almost changed me, but I realised what was happening.""

David and Louise Turpin cried as they apologised for the treatment of their children.

The 57-year-old father's lawyer read a prepared statement on his behalf, saying: ""My home schooling and discipline had good intentions.

""I never intended for any harm to come to my children. I love my children and I believe my children love me.""

He was an engineer for major US defence contractors Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman.

Speaking directly to the court, housewife Louise Turpin, 50, said she was ""truly sorry"" for what she had done.

""I love my children so much,"" she said. ""I really look forward to the day I can see them, hug them and tell them I'm sorry.""

The couple sat stony-faced as the judge rebuked them for their ""selfish, cruel and inhuman treatment"".

Judge Bernard Schwartz said: ""You have severed the ability to interact and raise your children that you have created and brought into this world.

""The only reason that your punishment is less than the maximum time in my opinion is because you accepted responsibility at an early stage in the proceeding.

""And you spared your children having to relive the humiliation and the harm they endured in that house of horrors.""

The tidy exterior of the middle-class family home 70 miles (112km) south of Los Angeles offered a veneer of respectability that masked the squalor and stench of human waste found by authorities within.

The children, between the ages of two to 29 at the time of the police raid, were severely malnourished.

A 22-year-old son was discovered chained to a bed. His two sisters had just been released from shackles.

The victims were forbidden to shower more than once a year, were unable to use the toilet and none of them had ever seen a dentist.

Some of the adult siblings' growth had been so severely stunted by starvation that authorities at first mistook them for children.

Newly released audio of their daughter's call to 911, obtained by ABC, provides a hint of the conditions in which the children lived.

""Two of my sisters and one of my brothers... they're chained up to their bed"", the 17-year-old girl, who did not know her own address, told the emergency operator.

""Sometimes I wake up and I can't breathe because how dirty the house is.""

The girl was also unaware of the year or month, or the meaning of the word ""medication"".

The children - whose names all begin with the letter J - were kept indoors, but were allowed out for Halloween, or on family trips to Disneyland and Las Vegas.

About 20 people from across the country, including nurses and psychologists, have offered to care for the seven adult siblings and six children.",,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-47991829,2019-04-19 20:57:59+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3053,abcnews--2019-12-10--Judge to consider delaying trial start in Parkland massacre,12/10/2019,abcnews,Judge to consider delaying trial start in Parkland massacre,"The judge overseeing the case of Florida school shooting defendant Nikolas Cruz said Tuesday she will consider a defense request to delay the start of trial beyond late January.

Broward Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer set a Dec. 19 date for arguments on the motion by defense lawyers who claim the case is moving much too swiftly and runs the risk of legal errors. That could mean a conviction of Cruz might be reversed on appeal, sending it back for another high-profile trial.

Prosecutors have been pushing hard to start the trial with jury selection beginning Jan. 27. Broward State Attorney Mike Satz, who is the chief prosecutor on the case, said the motion to delay trial must be heard quickly.

“We just can't wait until the last minute,” Satz said at a hearing.

Cruz, 21, faces 17 counts of first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted murder in the Valentine's Day 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. He faces the death penalty if convicted, although his lawyers say he will plead guilty in return for a life prison sentence.

In their motion, defense lawyers noted that of 38 capital punishment cases in Broward County since 1994, the average time they remained pending between arrest and trial was 52 months, or a little over four years.

On the current schedule, Cruz's trial would begin less than two years after the mass shooting on Feb. 14, 2018. He was arrested that same day. Defense lawyers say that is far too fast for them to adequately prepare a defense in a case of such magnitude.

“We want to make sure it's done once and it's done right,” said Gordon Weekes, chief assistant public defender in Broward County. “Expedience has taken precedence over the prudent disposition of this case.”

The defense motion suggests that one reason for the accelerated schedule is tha t Satz, retiring in 2020 after 44 years as top prosecutor, wants to get a conviction of Cruz next year. Another reason, the defense says, is that Scherer is up for re-election, and a third is simply the massive media attention the massacre has received.

Scherer sought Tuesday to keep the case on track for a Jan. 27 start by scheduling the December hearing on the motion for a continuance.

“It's better to have it sooner rather than later,” the judge said.

The defense motion notes that there are at least 1,000 witnesses identified by prosecutors in the case, and each of them must be interviewed by Cruz's lawyers. There are about 4 million pages of evidence, thousands of photos, videos, and social media posts and much more.

There is still a huge amount of work to be done by the defense, Weekes said.

“This court is pushing it forward at breakneck speed to acquiesce to the state,” he said.",,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/judge-delaying-trial-start-parkland-massacre-67632158,"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 17:00:33 -0500","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
9701,aljazeera--2019-02-12--Mexican drug lord Joaquin El Chapo Guzman guilty in US trial,2/12/2019,aljazeera,Mexican drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman guilty in US trial,"Notorious Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman was found guilty in a US court on Tuesday of operating a criminal enterprise.

Jurors in federal court in Brooklyn began delivering their verdict following an 11-week trial. Guzman, 61, now faces a possible sentence of life in prison.

Guzman was convicted on all 10 criminal charges he was tried for. US prosecutors said he had amassed a $14bn fortune through bribery, murder and drug smuggling.

Guzman, one of the major figures in Mexican drug wars that have roiled the country since 2006, was extradited to the United States for trial in 2017 after he was arrested in Mexico the year before.

Though other high-ranking cartel figures had been extradited previously, Guzman was the first to go to trial instead of pleading guilty.

Guzan's trial included nearly three months of testimony about a vast drug-smuggling conspiracy steeped in violence.

Throughout the months-long trial, the jury has heard more than 200 hours of testimony about Guzman's rise to power as the head of the Sinaloa cartel.

Prosecutors said he is responsible for smuggling at least 200 tonnes of cocaine into the US and a wave of killings in turf wars with other cartels.

The 11-week trial, which featured testimony from more than 50 witnesses, offered the public an unprecedented look into the inner workings of the cartel, named after the state in northwest Mexico where Guzman was born in a poor mountain village.

Prosecutors said he trafficked tonnes of cocaine, heroin, cannabis and methamphetamine into the US over more than two decades, consolidating his power in Mexico through murders and wars with rival cartels.

The defence has argued that Chapo was set up as a ""fall guy"" by Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, a drug kingpin from Sinaloa who remains at large.

Mexico has been mired for 12 years in a deadly military-led war against drug gangs. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador was elected last year after promising a change, suggesting a negotiated peace and amnesty for non-violent drug dealers, traffickers and farmers.

The most detailed evidence against Guzman came from more than a dozen former associates who struck deals to cooperate with US prosecutors.

Through them, jurors heard how the Sinaloa Cartel gained power amid the shifting allegiances of the Mexican drug trade in the 1990s, eventually coming to control almost the entire Pacific coast of Mexico.

They heard how Guzman made a name for himself in the 1980s as ""El Rapido"", the speedy one, by building cross-border tunnels that allowed him to move cocaine from Mexico into the US faster than anyone else.

The witnesses, who included some of Guzman's top lieutenants, a communications engineer and a one-time mistress, described how he built a sophisticated organisation reminiscent of a multinational corporation.

They described fleets of planes and boats, detailed accounting ledgers and an encrypted electronic communication system run through secret computer servers in Canada.

A former bodyguard testified that he watched Guzman kill three rival drug cartel members, including one victim who he shot and then ordered to be buried even as he was still gasping for air.

Estimates of how much money Guzman made from drugs vary.

In 2009, Forbes Magazine put him on its list of the world's richest people, with an estimated one billion dollars. It later dropped him from the list, saying it was too difficult to quantify his assets.

The US Justice Department said in 2017 it sought forfeiture of more than $14bn in drug proceeds and illicit profits from Guzman.

The trial also featured extensive testimony about corruption in Mexico, most of it involving bribes to law enforcement, military and local government officials so the cartel could carry out its day-to-day drug shipping operations undisturbed.

The most shocking allegation came from Guzman's former top aide Alex Cifuentes, who accused former Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto of taking a $100m bribe from Guzman. A spokesman for the ex-president has denied the claim.

In one of the trial's final days, Guzman told the judge he would not testify in his own defence.

The same day, he grinned broadly at audience member Alejandro Edda, the Mexican actor who plays Guzman in the Netflix drama ""Narcos"".

Despite his ties to government officials, Guzman often lived on the run.

Imprisoned in Mexico in 1993, he escaped in 2001 hidden in a laundry cart and spent the following years moving from one hideout to another in the mountains of Sinaloa, guarded by a private army.

He was seized and imprisoned again in 2014, but pulled off his best-known escape the following year when he disappeared into a tunnel dug into his cell in a maximum security prison.

But the Mexican government says he blew his cover through a series of slip-ups, including an attempt to make a movie about his life.

He was finally recaptured in January 2016 following a shoot-out in Sinaloa.",,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/02/mexican-drug-lord-joaquin-el-chapo-guzman-guilty-trial-190212173553615.html,2019-02-12 19:05:36+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
13074,aljazeera--2019-05-21--Portugal police officers sentenced in unprecedented trial,5/21/2019,aljazeera,Portugal police officers sentenced in unprecedented trial,"Lisbon, Portugal - Eight police officers were on Monday convicted of crimes ranging from aggravated kidnapping to grievous bodily harm against eight young black people in Lisbon.

It was the end - for now at least - of an unprecedented court case which saw seventeen agents on trial, bringing the issue of institutional racism and police violence in Portugal into the public eye. The sentences handed out, however, met disappointment, with both sides intending to appeal.

The case was brought against PSP (Portuguese, public-facing) police officers by the Public Ministry, and concerned the events of February 5, 2015, when police carried out an operation in Cova da Moura, a Lisbon neighbourhood known for its proud, predominantly Cape Verdean community. Two women, Neuza Correia and Jailsa Sousa - both bystanders - were left wounded after being shot with rubber-coated ammunition.

A series of police detentions during the operation were on Monday found to have been illegal, tantamount to aggravated kidnapping, and resulting in the grievous bodily harm of a further six people - Bruno Lopes, Rui Moniz, Celso Lopes, Flavio Almada, Paulo Veiga and Miguel Reis.

During the trial, it also emerged that police officers had falsified documentation and testimony in attempt to justify the detentions, alleging that the victims had been trying to ""storm"" the police station. While illegally detained, victims incurred injuries from broken bones to missing teeth. One was denied medication for a heart condition, the court heard.

In April, the Public Ministry dropped the accusation of ""racial hatred"", as well as an accusation of torture, in what was seen as a blow to the victims' case, which contained reports of repeated racial slurs and insults. All of the police officers in the case are white, and all of the defendants are black; however, racism is not a prosecutable criminal offence in Portugal.

""The kind of discrimination they face every day because they're poor and from working-class communities, because they're black, because they work on the informal market, and so on - all of the prejudice they face in the streets, they also experienced, unfortunately, within the courtroom,"" Lucia Gomes, the victims' lawyer, told Al Jazeera.

Monday's court session - the 34th since the trial got under way - began tensely, with at least 30 of the tiny courtroom's seats occupied quickly by off-duty police officers and police union reps, almost all of them men, who had been filling the corridors before the session began. That left only three seats for the victims. Their family and supporters - including the NGO SOS Racism - were forced to wait outside. When Judge Ester Pacheco entered the courtroom to read her final decision, there were only four black faces in the courtroom, including two of the victims - Flavio Almada and Celso Lopes - and their lawyer, Jose Semedo Fernandes.

Judge Pacheco ruled that only one police officer would serve a prison sentence - of one year and six months - because he was already under a suspended sentence. The remaining seven convicted officers were given suspended prison sentences of between two months and five years, with the police station chief Luís Anunciacao receiving the longest sentence. The judge rejected the police officers' version of events almost in its entirety, referring in detail to the Police Code and to the Portuguese constitution to make her points about professionalism and human rights.

However, it was the awarding of substantial compensation to the victims - which some officers will have to pay - that caused the most upset in the courtroom. Six of the victims were awarded payouts of around 10,000 euros ($11,160). Anunciacao received the largest bill, having been ordered to pay 50,000 euros ($55,780) to the victims.

There were emotional scenes outside the courtroom as some victims and supporters cautiously celebrated a small but significant victory. Lawyer Lucia Gomes was clearly relieved yet reserved in her reaction: ""I can't say that I'm happy,"" she told Al Jazeera. ""The court had every possibility to go much further than it did.""

On social media, prominent members of Portuguese anti-racism movements denounced the sentences as ""shameful"" and ""pitiful"".

""The fact that organised Black movements have emerged onto the public sphere in recent years may explain the small victory of today,"" Pedro Schacht Pereira, an associate professor of Portuguese at the Ohio State University, told Al Jazeera. ""It is a ruling that gives an air of decency to the justice system, while preserving intact the idea that racism is not a Portuguese problem, since those charges were dropped.""

""It's bittersweet,"" said SOS Racism director Mamadou Ba after the session, calling the sentences ""disproportionate"" to the crimes committed. ""Furthermore, the u-turn that the Public Ministry performed [on the charges of racism and torture] pose a serious challenge in the fight against institutional racism.""

The seventeen police officers were greeted with applause as they left the court building in Sintra - but many of them looked shaken. At least two have already made denouncements of slander against some of the victims. Peixoto Rodrigues, a police union leader, said they intended to appeal: ""First, we're going to analyse the decision that's been made.""

The sentencing comes a year since the trial began - and more than four years after the events it dealt with. ""I think they got off lightly,"" Flavio Almada told reporters outside the courthouse. ""Our families, our friends, and our community have suffered greatly.""",,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/portugal-police-officers-sentenced-unprecedented-trial-190521121012100.html,2019-05-21 14:46:54+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
14998,aljazeera--2019-08-06--Trial begins for priests accused of abusing Argentine students,8/6/2019,aljazeera,Trial begins for priests accused of abusing Argentine students,"Two priests and a gardener have appeared in court to face charges of sexually abusing deaf children in their care, in a case that has sent shockwaves through Argentina's Catholic church.

Priests Nicola Corradi, an 83-year-old Italian, and 59-year-old Argentine Horacio Corbacho, as well as former gardener Armando Gomez, 63, are accused of sexual abuse, corruption of children and mistreatment at a Catholic school for deaf children.

They face prison sentences of up to 20 years in some cases, up to 50 years in others.

The case relates to the abuse of around 20 children from the Provolo Institute in the western town of Mendoza. Corradi headed the institute, founded in 1995, until his arrest in November 2016.

As the three accused - Corbacho and Gomez in handcuffs - were led down a long corridor in Mendoza's Palace of Justice on Monday to a court where three judges awaited them, alleged victims and their relatives protested outside, with one sign saying ""With Our Hands And Our Voices We Break The Silence,"" a reference to sign language.

""I am super-nervous, anxious and I hope for justice; that this ends soon so my son can move on to a new stage because this is very hard,"" said Natalia Villalonga, whose 18-year-old son Ezequiel was one of the students abused at the Provolo Institute.

The alleged abuse took place between 2004 and 2016, and the case gained world attention when it emerged that Corradi had faced similar accusations at the Antonio Provolo Institute in Verona, Italy, and Pope Francis had been notified the Italian priest was running a similar centre in Argentina.

Corbacho has pleaded not guilty to the sexual abuse charges, while Corradi and Gomez have not entered pleas.

The closed-doors trial, expected to last two months, will hear testimony from 13 victims who suffered abuse between the ages of four and 17.

It is the first in a series of trials involving other former members of the now-closed school.

Others implicated include two nuns who allegedly participated or knew about the abuses, as well as former directors and employees who are accused of knowing about the abuse but taking no action.

Jorge Bordon, an institute employee, was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2018 in a case of rape, sexual touching and corrupting minors.

Corradi moved to Argentina in 1970 from the original Provolo Institute in Verona - which has also been shaken by a paedophilia scandal in recent years - to run the Provolo in La Plata, before transferring to the Mendoza institute in 1998.

His name appeared in a letter addressed to the pope in 2014 in which the Italian accusers mentioned several allegedly abusive priests who continued to exercise the ministry and said that Corradi and three other priests were in Argentina.

The Verona diocese sanctioned four of the 24 defendants, but not Corradi.

32983,bbc--2019-11-21--France Elodie Kulik murder trial after 17-year fight for justice,11/21/2019,bbc,France Elodie Kulik murder trial after 17-year fight for justice,"Elodie Kulik was heading home from a restaurant in January 2002 when she was abducted, raped and then murdered.

A 24-year-old bank manager working in the northern French town of Péronne, her car was targeted in an ambush and as she tried to call emergency services she was dragged from her vehicle.

Despite a huge inquiry, no arrests were made and the trail then went cold.

Now, after a relentless campaign by her father and ingenious use of DNA, a man has gone on trial 17 years later.

Willy Bardon, 45, denies kidnapping, rape and murder and sat beside his lawyer as the trial got under way at a court in Amiens.

Elodie's father, Jacky Kulik, arrived early for Thursday's trial. He lost his first two children in a car accident when they were five and six years old. His wife died in 2011 after trying to take her life and ending up in a coma.

Cameras were allowed in the court as the judges arrived.

Why it took so long

The Elodie Kulik murder case went cold for a decade, until advances in DNA helped identify one of her attackers.

The victim's body was found by a farmer on 12 January 2002 on a disused airbase. What was found at the crime scene gave investigators evidence they were able to use 10 years later - even though it was unusable at the time.

Elodie had been partly burned by her killers. Traces of semen were found in a condom along with four sets of incomplete DNA and a fingerprint.

While police interviewed 10,000 people and analysed 14,000 phone records, the DNA samples they had gathered failed to come up with a match on the national crime database. There was no broader DNA database at the time and the samples did not match anyone tested as part of the inquiry.

In January 2011, a gendarmerie captain, Emmanuel Pham-Hoai, came up with the idea of using a technique tried out in Wales and in the US but never before in France.

Instead of looking for a direct DNA match he searched for similar matches that might indicate a relative within the system - known as familial DNA searching.
• How familial DNA trapped a murderer for the first time

Within days, the DNA from the condom matched a man already in prison. Detectives told Le Monde newspaper how they then approached his wife and were able to confirm that the sample matched their children.

They narrowed down their search to Grégory Wiart, a heating engineer who had died in a car accident in 2003. His body was exhumed and police then said they were sure he was one of the killers.

Shortly afterwards police detained seven members of the same family, including Willy Bardon, the man on trial. He originally came from the same village as Wiart.

Mr Bardon was charged after his voice was linked to the phone call made by Elodie Kulik to the emergency services. Male voices had been audible in the background and police say when they played the tape to Wiart's relatives, five of them recognised his voice.

The defendant denies the voice was his. One of his lawyers, Stéphane Daquo, told AFP news agency this was ""the only trial where everyone who has their DNA at the scene of the crime is a witness and the only one who doesn't is accused"".

St. Louis aldermen unanimously gave final approval to the bill Friday. Supporters say 30% of criminals who try to purchase guns but fail to do so because of background checks are arrested within five years. The bill awaits Democratic Mayor Lyda Krewson's signature.

Missouri's big cities, St. Louis and Kansas City, have among the highest homicide rates in the nation. Both are seeking to address the problem through tougher local gun laws since statewide legislation is unlikely in the conservative-led state, where Republican Gov. Mike Parson has pledged ""to protect the rights of the Second Amendment for law-abiding citizens.""

A message left with Parson's office was not immediately returned Friday.

In St. Louis, where Parson assigned highway patrol officers to help fight crime in September, the situation is made more tragic by the fact that 13 of those killed in shootings this year were children, all of them black.

St. Louis aldermanic President Lewis Reed said the city law will help alert police to people with criminal records who are seeking guns.

""This is one more piece to the puzzle, and it's an important piece,"" Reed said. ""We're no longer going to wait for the state to do the right thing, or the federal government to do the right thing.""

It wasn't immediately clear if the attorney general's office in Missouri would challenge the law on grounds that it conflicts with state law. A spokesman for Attorney General Eric Schmitt declined comment, saying the office had not seen details.

Another St. Louis measure under consideration would designate the city's parks as child care facilities so they're exempt from a Missouri law allowing people to carry concealed firearms without permits and training. Signs explaining the gun prohibition would be posted at park entrances, parking areas, playgrounds and sports fields. Several St. Louis killings have happened at parks or near them.

Child cares, churches, hospitals and some other places can ban the carrying of guns under state law. But parks are not on the list.

In Kansas City, the City Council approved two laws aimed at keeping guns away from children. One of the laws, passed in August, makes it a local offense for minors to have handguns. The other prohibits adults from recklessly giving minors guns without their parents' permission.

Last week, Democratic Kansas City Mayor Quinton Lucas proposed an ordinance that would allow police to take firearms from domestic violence offenders or those who are the subject of restraining orders. A similar federal law exists but backers say a local law would help police and prosecutors pursue the cases.

St. Louis has had 165 homicides in 2019 and is on pace to top last year's total of 186. In Kansas City, 122 homicides have occurred this year, and the city is on pace to top last year's 138 killings.",,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/st-louis-kc-seek-tougher-gun-laws-amid-66694945,"Fri, 01 Nov 2019 17:11:56 -0400","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has been amended to criminalize passing money or objects through car windows to someone on a public road, making such acts punishable with fines or jail. The council is set to vote again on the ordinance on Tuesday.

Prosecutors filed one charge against Clifton Blackwell — first-degree reckless injury — but added the sentencing enhancers of hate crime and use of a dangerous weapon. The two enhancers could add 10 years in prison if he's convicted of first-degree reckless injury, which is punishable by up to 25 years.

The victim, Mahud Villalaz, 42, said his attacker approached him near a restaurant Friday night and confronted him about being parked too close to a bus stop, according to charging documents. Prosecutors said Blackwell then asked, ""Why did you invade my country?"" and ""Why don't you respect my laws?""

Villalaz said he moved his car but that Blackwell continued to berate him, calling him ""illegal"" and telling him to ""go back, go back,"" followed by an expletive. Villalaz said he called Blackwell a racist, also using an expletive. Villalaz said Blackwell threw the acid on him after Villalaz said ""everyone come from somewhere first"" and that American Indians had been in the country the longest.

Surveillance video from the restaurant recorded the attack, which left Villalaz with second-degree burns on his face.

Villalaz is a U.S. citizen who immigrated from Peru.

Blackwell made his first court appearance Wednesday to be advised of the charges he faces. Bond was set at $20,000 but it's on the condition he wear an electronic monitoring bracelet. He's still being held at the Milwaukee County jail and his public defender did not immediately return a call.

The attack on Villalaz comes at a time when the Anti-Defamation League says extreme anti-immigrant views have become part of the political mainstream in recent years through sharp rhetoric by anti-immigration groups and politicians, including President Donald Trump.

White House spokesman Judd Deere said Monday that the Trump administration has repeatedly condemned racism and violence.

Investigators who searched Blackwell's home found among other things four bottles of sulfuric acid, muriatic acid, and two bottles of Kleen-Out drain opener that was 100 % lye, according to the search warrant. Additional conditions for his bond are that he have no contact with acids or large batteries, or possess dangerous weapons or firearms. His next court appearance is Nov. 15.

Before filing the charge, Milwaukee District Attorney John Chisholm said during an interview with Wisconsin Public Radio that his office was looking to determine whether the attack was motivated ""in whole or in part"" based on the victim's race. He said prosecutors would look ""very closely first at the underlying offenses and then we'll make a determination whether the facts support the hate crime.""

""But it's obviously a concern to many people not just in this community but really around the country right now,"" he said.

Just as Blackwell was in court, Villalaz spoke briefly to reporters to say he was pleased with the charges and thankful for ""the people that have worried about me."" He said Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin called him to say she was ""very sad"" about what happened and offered to help however she can.

His mother, Jacqueline P. Blackwell, of California, told the Journal Sentinel he had sought care with the Department of Veterans Affairs in Milwaukee for post-traumatic stress.

""I was comfortable that he was getting good care with the VA,"" she told the newspaper.

His brother, Arthur Eugene Blackwell of Evergreen, Colorado, told the AP that Clifton served nearly four years in the U.S. Marines and was stationed at the Panama Canal around the time Manuel Noriega was captured and removed in 1990. A Marine official told AP that the branch doesn't have a record matching Blackwell's name and birthdate.

2476,abcnews--2019-11-21--Lawsuit alleges McDonald’s puts employees in physical danger,11/21/2019,abcnews,Lawsuit alleges McDonald’s puts employees in physical danger,"A group of employees from 13 McDonald’s restaurants in Chicago filed a lawsuit Thursday alleging that the company’s drive for profits puts workers at “daily risk” of physical attack by dangerous customers.

In the lawsuit filed in Cook County court, the 17 workers say McDonald’s has failed to protect them from what they say is a “citywide and nationwide” pattern of violence and that police respond to more than 20 911 calls every day regarding Chicago McDonald’s restaurants. They cite several examples of the violence, including an incident in which a customer beat an employee with a sign and another in which a customer urinated on a worker.

“McDonald’s has failed, at a systemic level, to protect its workers from violence in the workplace,” said Danny Rosenthal, an attorney for the workers. “Throughout the country, McDonald’s workers are regularly threatened, assaulted, and injured by customers.”

McDonald’s did not respond to the lawsuit’s specific allegations, but it said in a statement that, “McDonald’s takes seriously its responsibility to provide and foster a safe working environment for our employees, and along with our franchisees, continue to make investments in training programs that uphold safe environments for customers and crew members.”

The lawsuit contends that in its effort to increase profits, McDonald’s has taken steps that have made working at its restaurants more dangerous. For example, it alleges that by lowering and tearing down physical barriers at check-out counters, the company has made it easier for dangerous customers to attack workers. McDonald’s has also ignored the “recommended practice” of designing drive-thru windows so that customers cannot crawl through them, according to the lawsuit.

Because McDonald’s does not allow workers to lock bathroom doors when they are sent there to clean them, the company puts workers at greater risk of sexual violence, the lawsuit asserts. One of the plaintiffs “was cleaning inside the men’s bathroom when men entered and exposed themselves to her in a sexual manner,” it states.

The lawsuit marks the latest in a string of legal problems for the fast food giant. McDonald’s has faced protests and dozens of lawsuits over what workers call sexual harassment at its restaurants and the company’s failure to address their complaints. Earlier this month, a former employee sued McDonald’s and one of its Michigan franchisees, alleging that the general manager did nothing to stop a co-worker from groping and physically assaulting her. And just days before that lawsuit was filed, McDonald’s fired its CEO, Steve Easterbrook, for having a consensual romantic relationship with an employee.",,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/lawsuit-alleges-mcdonalds-puts-employees-physical-danger-67201280,"Thu, 21 Nov 2019 18:09:53 -0500","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

New York City lawmakers have voted to ban flavored electronic cigarettes.

The City Council voted Tuesday to ban all e-cigarette and e-liquid flavors except tobacco.

Backers of the ban said they were acting to protect young people whose use of e-cigarettes has surged in recent years. Democratic City Council member Mark Levine said there is “no higher obligation” than protecting the health of kids.

Supporters of the vaping industry jeered and threw dollar bills from the balcony of the City Council chamber after the vote.

Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio has said he supports the ban and will either sign the legislation into law or let it take effect automatically.

New York City lawmakers are preparing to ban flavored electronic cigarettes.

The bill before the City Council on Tuesday would ban all e-cigarette and e-liquid flavors except tobacco. More than half of the Council’s 51 members have signed on as co-sponsors.

A spokeswoman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said the Democratic mayor supports the ban and will either sign the legislation into law or let it take effect automatically.

2834,abcnews--2019-12-04--Judge to hear bid to end John Dillinger exhumation lawsuit,12/4/2019,abcnews,Judge to hear bid to end John Dillinger exhumation lawsuit,"A judge will hear an Indianapolis cemetery's bid Wednesday to dismiss a lawsuit filed by a relative of 1930s gangster John Dillinger who wants to exhume Dillinger’s gravesite to determine if the notorious criminal is actually buried there.

A Marion County judge scheduled a hearing to consider Crown Hill Cemetery's motion to dismiss the lawsuit Michael Thompson filed in August against the cemetery. Thompson, who is Dillinger’s nephew, is seeking a court order allowing him to proceed with the exhumation.

He obtained a permit in October from the Indiana State Department of Health that calls for the remains to be exhumed on Dec. 31. Thompson has said he has evidence Dillinger's body may not be buried there, and he may not have been the man FBI agents fatally shot outside a Chicago theater in on July 22, 1934.

Attorneys for Crown Hill Cemetery call that “a decades-old conspiracy.” They oppose the exhumation, saying that Indiana’s Legislature has granted cemetery owners the right to “protect its gravesites from unwarranted disturbance.”

They argue that state law specifies that a deceased person cannot be removed from a cemetery without the written consent of that cemetery, as well as a written order from the State Department authorizing the removal and the written consent of certain relatives of the deceased.

In September, The History Channel dropped out of a planned documentary on Dillinger that would have included the exhumation.

Thompson and another relative applied for the state exhumation permit after they obtained an earlier permit calling for a Sept. 16 exhumation.

3118,abcnews--2019-12-11--US seeks dismissal of New Mexico's immigration lawsuit,12/11/2019,abcnews,US seeks dismissal of New Mexico's immigration lawsuit,"ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. -- U.S. lawyers want a judge to dismiss claims by New Mexico that immigration officials shirked their duties earlier this year by quickly releasing thousands of mostly Central American migrants into communities after they crossed into the United States.

New Mexico claimed in a lawsuit filed in June that the practice left Las Cruces, Deming and other communities to pick up the tab for housing and feeding the asylum-seekers until they moved on to find relatives or other hosts elsewhere in the U.S.

In addition to seeking an end to the catch-and-release practice, the state sought reimbursement for humanitarian efforts to temporarily shelter migrants. The state resorted to issuing its own grants to help communities with the costs.

U.S. District Judge James Browning heard arguments Wednesday but he noted that it could take a while before he issues a decision on whether the case will be allowed to move forward. He cited an ongoing backlog of federal cases in New Mexico.

First-year Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, an outspoken critic of President Donald Trump and his immigration policies, cited a ""derogation of duty"" when she announced the lawsuit against then-acting Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and top immigration officials. The city of Albuquerque was listed as a co-plaintiff.

The complaint resembled a suit filed by San Diego County in April that challenged the cancellation of a federal program that helped migrants with phone calls and other travel logistics as they sought final destinations across the U.S.

The quick releases in New Mexico came as the border was inundated with migrants seeking asylum. At times, groups of 300 or more people showed up at remote outposts, including the crossings at Antelope Wells and at Sunland Park, closer to El Paso, Texas.

Attorneys for the state and the city told the judge about the hundreds of people who were dropped off in Deming in the middle of summer.

“It's not an option to ignore those people,” said Jonathan Guss, the governor's deputy general counsel.

He pointed to state responsibilities for ensuring public health and safety for all people within its jurisdiction and argued that the federal government's actions forced New Mexico to step up.

Deputy City Attorney Winter Torres said local officials had only 10 to 12 hours of notification before some 300 migrants were released on Easter weekend. She suggested that the federal government was targeting the city because of its immigrant-friendly policies.

Federal officials have denied those claims, and attorneys for the government argued Wednesday that New Mexico and the city had no standing to bring the lawsuit because the previous safe release policy was not something that was ever formally adopted through regulations or statute and thus left to the discretion of immigration officials.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Manuel Lucero told the judge that had Congress intended every discretionary decision an agency makes to be reviewed, government would grind to a halt and the courts would be flooded by complaints every time someone disagreed with a policy change.

While acknowledging that the immigration and asylum system was overwhelmed, Lucero said the federal government never forced the state or city to spend their money on humanitarian efforts.

“It's discretionary spending on their part. It's commendable. It really is,” he said, adding that no existing regulations, codes or statutes require the federal government to provide shelter, food or other humanitarian aid to all asylum-seekers and that it did not do so under the previous policy. Such aid, he said, is provided only on a case-by-case basis — for example if a migrant is ill and needs medical care.

In May, at the height of immigrant apprehensions the El Paso Sector — which includes New Mexico’s stretch of the border — saw nearly 30,000 families come through. The numbers dropped quickly over the summer in the busiest crossing spots, the result of several policies making it nearly impossible to gain asylum in the U.S.

New Mexico's congressional delegation was able to secure $30 million in grants for communities and organizations that aided asylum seekers. The first wave of supplemental funding came in October, but the state said Wednesday that its application for reimbursement from the U.S. government was still pending.

Details on the amount of reimbursement being sought were not immediately available.",,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-seeks-dismissal-mexicos-immigration-lawsuit-67663084,"Wed, 11 Dec 2019 21:22:04 -0500","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The state of Maryland and the District of Columbia will ask the full 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to reconsider a ruling by a three-judge panel that directed a federal judge in Maryland to dismiss the lawsuit.

The two jurisdictions allege that Trump has violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution by accepting profits through foreign and domestic officials who stay at the Trump International Hotel.

Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh and District Attorney General Karl Racine have argued that hotels in their jurisdictions suffer “competitive injury” because officials hoping to curry favor with the president are more likely to stay at his hotel.

A three-judge panel of the 4th Circuit ruled in July that the two jurisdictions lack standing to pursue their claims against the president. The court later granted a request to hold a rehearing before all 15 judges on the court.

Trump's lawyers have said that Frosh and Racine — both Democrats — lack authority to sue the president in his official capacity. They've also argued that the emoluments clause only bars compensation made in connection with services provided in his official capacity or in ""an employment-type relationship"" with a foreign or domestic government.

6,21stcenturywire--2019-01-02--White House Lawyer Giuliani Assange Should Not Be Prosecuted,1/2/2019,21stcenturywire,White House Lawyer Giuliani: ‘Assange Should Not Be Prosecuted’,"

 This latest admission by White House legal counsel, Rudy Giuliani, is certain to send shock waves through the corridors of the deep state in both Washington and London. For years, the Anglo-American establishment has been trying to frame Julian Assange and WikiLeaks for a crime which was nonexistent. Once again, as the Russiagate narrative starts to disintegrate, common sense is beginning to fill the vacuum left by the hemorrhaging credibility of the political media establishment.

Giuliani’s legal analysis will no doubt upset US officials who have repeatedly referred to WikiLeaks as “a non-state hostile intelligence service” This disingenuous claim has been dutifully repeatedly by US officials, and particularly by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who seems to be unable to grasp the basic concept that  Wikileaks is a publisher, and falls squarely under the auspices of press freedom protections.

Could this be that elusive legal daylight that supporters of Julian Assange have been waiting for?

Rudy Giuliani, a lawyer for President Donald Trump, said Monday that WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange had not done “anything wrong” and should not go to jail for disseminating stolen information just as major media does.

“Let’s take the Pentagon Papers,” Giuliani told Fox News. “The Pentagon Papers were stolen property, weren’t they?  It was in The New York Times and The Washington Post.  Nobody went to jail at The New York Times and The Washington Post.”

Giuliani said there were “revelations during the Bush administration” such as Abu Ghraib.  “All of that is stolen property taken from the government, it’s against the law. But once it gets to a media publication, they can publish it,” Giuliani said, “for the purpose of informing people.”

“You can’t put Assange in a different position,” he said. “He was a guy who communicated.”

Giuliani said, “We may not like what [Assange] communicates, but he was a media facility. He was putting that information out,” he said. “Every newspaper and station grabbed it, and published it.”

The U.S. government has admitted that it has indicted Assange for publishing classified information, but it is battling in court to keep the details of the indictment secret. As a lawyer and close advisor to Trump, Giuliani could have influence on the president’s and the Justice Department’s thinking on Assange.

Giuliani also said there was no coordination between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks. “I  was with Donald Trump day in and day out during the last four months of the campaign,” he said. “He was as surprised as I was about the WikiLeaks disclosures.  Sometimes surprised to the extent of ‘Oh my god, did they really say that?’ We were wondering if it was true. They [the Clinton campaign] never denied it.”

Giuliani said: “The thing that really got Hillary is not so much that it was revealed, but they were true. They actually had people as bad as that and she really was cheating on the debates. She really was getting from Donna Brazile the questions before hand. She really did completely screw Bernie Sanders.”

“Every bit of that was true,” he went on.  “Just like the Pentagon Papers put a different view on Vietnam, this put a different view on Hillary Clinton.”

Giuliani said, “It was not right to hack. People who did it should go to jail, but no press person or person disseminating that for the purpose of informing did anything wrong.”",21wire,https://21stcenturywire.com/2019/01/02/white-house-lawyer-giuliani-says-assange-should-not-be-prosecuted/,2019-01-02 23:53:54+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
453,21stcenturywire--2019-07-18--CIA Pushes for Expansion of Secrecy Laws to Shutdown Public Criticism,7/18/2019,21stcenturywire,CIA Pushes for Expansion of Secrecy Laws to Shutdown Public Criticism,"When the CIA and other agencies in the United States government pushed for the Intelligence Identities Protection Act (IIPA) in 1981, it was crafted to exclude “covert agents” who resided in the U.S.

There was consideration by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of how the legislation might “chill or stifle public criticism of intelligence activities or public debate concerning intelligence policy.”

More than three decades later, the CIA is apparently unsatisfied with the protections the bill granted covert agents.

It has enlisted a select group of senators and representatives to help expand the universe of individuals who are protected, making members of the press who cover intelligence matters more vulnerable to prosecution.

Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, chairman of the House intelligence committee, was involved in adding language to expand the IIPA to the Intelligence Authorization Act moving through Congress.

The CIA put their specific request for what language they would like amended in writing and sent it to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Their request was essentially copied and pasted, with no changes, into the intelligence bill.

Schiff supports the prosecution of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange and shares the CIA’s view that WikiLeaks is a “non-state hostile intelligence service,” not a media organization.

In 2018, when Assange was willing to speak with investigators about the Russia probe, he replied,

Senator Ron Wyden, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, said he is concerned about how the bill expands the IIPA so that it applies indefinitely, including to individuals who have been in the United States for decades and have become senior management or have retired.”

Gina Haspel, the CIA director, likely favors the law because she faced scrutiny over her role in the destruction of torture tapes that showed the waterboarding of Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. She was still a “covert agent” when news of this scandal erupted, and the protection of her identity played a role in enabling her ascension to the top of the agency.

Various groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, Demand Progress, Human Rights Watch, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Physicians for Human Rights, the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, and the Society of Professional Journalists, wrote a letter objecting to the proposed expansion that was sent to both intelligence committees.

The groups contend it would “harm congressional oversight of the intelligence community, making it much more difficult to obtain information about almost any individual’s relationship to intelligence agencies and allowing the executive branch to avoid oversight through arbitrary classification. Additionally, it would potentially make it more difficult for intelligence community whistleblowers to approach Congress with reports of fraud, waste, and abuse.”

The letter further argues it would be “significantly damaging” because it is an “extremely broad expansion of felony criminal penalties and delegates authority to when those penalties apply to the executive branch.”

When the IIPA was drafted in 1981, the ACLU initially opposed [PDF] it. Yet, as Angus MacKenzie described, ACLU attorney Jerry Berman and Morton Halperin, who became the ACLU director in 1984 after passage of the bill, worked with the CIA on a compromise in July 1981, which offered journalists some small measure of protection.

Nonetheless, before the Senate Subcommittee on Security and Terrorism, which was part of the Judiciary Committee, Halperin articulated a case against the IIPA on May 8, 1981.

Halperin suggested it would be better for the government to focus on taking steps to “make it impossible for foreign terrorist groups or American citizens” to “identify covert agents.” Legislation impinging on the First Amendment should not be passed for a “symbolic purpose.” It should pass because it will have some “real effect on protecting lives.”

The ACLU and other organizations believed the legislation, as it was drafted, would make it a crime “for the press to publish information which it lawfully acquires, whether it acquires that information from foreign intelligence sources, from foreign governments, from foreign newspapers, [or] from official publications of the United States government.”

There was nothing in the language that required a “bad purpose” to exist in order for a person to be prosecuted.

It is not like the law has not been abused by the U.S. government.

In 2013, the Justice Department successfully prosecuted former CIA officer John Kiriakou for confirming the name of an officer involved in the CIA’s RDI program to a reporter, even though he did not have a “pattern of activity” which involved trying to out “covert agents.”

Members of Congress specified in the IIPA that a person must be engaged in a “series” of acts or a “pattern of activity” that was intended to “impair or impede the foreign intelligence activities of the United States by the fact of such identification and exposure.”

It was viewed as a kind of protection for journalists. However, in Kiriakou’s case, there was enough ambiguity to deploy it against a former officer who had a public record of opposing the agency’s use of waterboarding against detainees in the “war on terrorism.”

The Justice Department did not use the law when CIA officer Valerie Plame had her cover blown by officials in President George W. Bush’s administration. Her outing was retaliation against her husband, former diplomat Joseph Wilson, who exposed part of the fabricated case for regime change in Iraq.

Former CIA case officer Philip Agee, who sought to reveal how the CIA was involved in “secretly intervening in country after country to corrupt politicians and to promote political repression,” was the key inspiration for the CIA push to pass the IIPA. Agee published a column, “Naming Names,” that outed agents allegedly involved in the activities he exposed.

In 1975, Agee was blamed by the CIA for the murder of Richard Welch, the CIA station chief in Athens, but Agee maintained the publication had nothing to do with the murder of Welch.

Three decades ago, the CIA mobilized to protect itself from radical acts of transparency, and now, with the internet and organizations like WikiLeaks, it hopes to be able to further isolate and criminalize those who directly challenge the agency’s activities.

562,21stcenturywire--2019-08-31--Adam Schiffs New Law Expands Definition of Domestic Terrorism Promotes FBI Entrapment,8/31/2019,21stcenturywire,"Adam Schiff’s New Law Expands Definition of ‘Domestic Terrorism’, Promotes FBI Entrapment","

 Recently, the US House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-CA) introduced a bill which intends to criminalize various new acts under the ever-expanding banner of domestic terrorism. Undoubtedly, this is an attempt by the government to broaden the definition of ‘domestic terrorism’ in order to make the interpretation more arbitrary, and thus qualifying more offenses for terrorism prosecutions.

Schiff’s new law will give the US Attorney General new powers which would potentially charge any threat of violence or damage to property that “creates a substantial risk of serious bodily injury” – as an act of domestic terrorism.

Potentially, this might could also include the use of heated political rhetoric during a “planning meeting” (a conversation in person, or in an internet chat room), or even breaking a window during a protest. In theory, the Federal government could them pursue sentences up to 30-years in prison.

Predictably, mainstream partisan pundits are cheering this authoritarian move by Schiff, as they believe that this legislation will give the state more power to crack down on what they perceive as their political enemies, namely ‘white supremacists’ and ‘white nationalists. It’s important to point out that this same reactionary, flawed logic was used by Neconservatives in the wake of 9/11 in order to target and ‘deal with’ the supposed ‘Muslim threat’ by rushing through Patriot Act I and II during the Bush Administration.

Writing for The Hill, Michael German offers a few real-life scenarios, explaining, “If you think this possibility is absurd, keep in mind that in 2012 the Justice Department put two political activists in jail for months for refusing to testify before a grand jury about colleagues who may have participated in a Seattle May Day protest in which a federal courthouse window was broken,” adding that, “In 2017, the Justice Department charged more than 200 protesters at an anti-Trump rally with felony charges for allegedly conspiring to riot because someone broke windows and lit a limousine on fire while they were in the general vicinity. Prosecutors used selectively edited undercover recordings of protest planning meetings in which a speaker threatened to turn the inauguration into a “giant clusterf—” as evidence of a broad conspiracy.”

“The prosecutions failed in these cases, which may partly explain why the Justice Department and FBI have been seeking to expand their domestic terrorism powers. If they were intent on using these new powers to target far-right militants, they could have simply amended current Justice Department policies that de-prioritize the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes,” said German.

Schiff federal power-grab is a bi-partisan effort – because both the Republican and Democratic wings of the Establishment will want to use such broad powers in order to marginalize their perceived political opponents, or worse – use the FBI to fabricate terror plots in order to create and maintain an ongoing crisis through which it can reinforce convenient political and state-power narratives and also justify increasing departmental expenditures.

In short, this breed of new legislation will only give the FBI increased license to continue and expand upon its highly shady practice of using handlers and informants to entrap and arrest unsuspecting dupes, and further boast to the press about the impressive number of “terror busts” it has referred to prosecution.

All the while, short-sighted partisan lawmakers remain oblivious to the long-term consequences of reactionary such policy.",21wire,https://21stcenturywire.com/2019/08/31/adam-schiffs-new-law-set-to-expand-the-definition-of-domestic-terrorism/,2019-08-31 10:32:01+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
592,21stcenturywire--2019-09-11--Remain Roadblock Scottish Court Rules PMs Suspension of Parliament Unlawful,9/11/2019,21stcenturywire,Remain Roadblock: Scottish Court Rules PM’s Suspension of Parliament ‘Unlawful’,"

 Scotland’s highest civil court has ruled today that Boris Johnson’s suspension of the UK Parliament is unlawful. A three judge panel at the Court of Session in Ednburgh ruled in favour of a cross-party group of politicians, stating that the Prime Minister’s prorogation is an attempt to ‘prevent Parliament holding the government to account ahead of Brexit.’

Both Labour and Scottish National Party (SNP) are demanding an immediate recall of Parliament.

However, this latest Scottish ruling appears to contradict previous statements made by judges in London, as well as the initial findings by the same Edinburgh court last Wednesday when Lord Doherty stated that PM Johnson’s prorogation was lawful.

In response, Johnson’s government has said it will appeal the ruling in the country’s Supreme Court in London who will make the final decision on the matter. The case will be heard next Tuesday.

As of Wednesday, no final decision has been made to immediately reverse the PM’s suspension of Parliament, but according to the House Speaker’s office, Parliament can only be recalled if the government so chooses.

According earlier reports from The Guardian in London, Sir Ed Davey, the deputy Liberal Democrat leader, this ruling could lead to the resignation of Boris Johnson:

“It could well do. If he has been found to have misled the Queen, I think the whole nation will be deeply shocked and alarmed. This is a prime minister we already know has said he might obey a law in parliament, so he is behaving in the most disgraceful way. Now it may be that the supreme court next week overturns the decision. But that three judges, independent judges, could come to this conclusion today is a real blow to the government, and it also backs what Liberal Democrats and others have been saying, this government should not have silenced parliament.”

Fresh attacks against the Prime Minister are also coming from the Tory rebel’s camp, as Dominic Grieve, the former Conservative attorney general (and one of the 21 MPs who had the whip removed last week), said to BBC News that, if Boris Johnson misled the Queen about the reasons for prorogation, then he should resign:

The Guardian added that, “Grieve was also the MP who tabled by standing order 24 motion passed by MPs on Monday demanding the release of private messages from Johnson’s aides relating to the prorogation of parliament. In the debate he said government whistleblowers who had told him what really happened thought the affair “smacked of scandal”.",21wire,https://21stcenturywire.com/2019/09/11/remain-roadblock-scottish-court-rules-pms-suspension-of-parliament-unlawful/,2019-09-11 12:17:49+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
815,abcnews--2019-01-03--Law enforcement unions frustrated over members missing pay amid shutdown,1/3/2019,abcnews,Law enforcement unions frustrated over members missing pay amid shutdown,"The heads of unions representing federal law enforcement have some choice words for President Donald Trump amid the government shutdown.

The chief of the union that represents officers working for the Transportation Security Administration, whose members are responsible for securing airline travelers, expressed strong frustration Thursday at the prospect of missing paychecks if the government shutdown drags on.

""How can you protect people who fly when you're worried about paying your bills?"" Hydrick Thomas, TSA Council President, told ABC News.

Thomas said that 45,000 TSA employees aren't getting paid, and there is nothing that they can do about it.

""That is our Christmas gift from our president, not going to get paid,"" Thomas continued. He added that he hoped the president would ""wake up.""

While Acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker effusively praised the president Wednesday for ""giving up"" his holiday to deal with the government shutdown, he failed to mention the thousands of federal agents in the Department of Justice were also working -- and not getting paid.

One of those agencies that Whitaker oversees is the Federal Bureau of Prisons.

“We just passed New Year's and New Year's for most of us is when we pay our mortgages, our rents and many people have been expressing through and on social media, that they went to their landlords and their landlords stated they have got to get the bills paid, and if they don’t, they’re going to come and find their stuff out on the front lawn,” Eric Young, the head of the Federal Bureau of Prisons Union, told ABC News.

“In prisons, you can’t cut back on services. The results are more violence, unsafe prisons, people being killed -- the inmates and also the staff. So, when you have them being distracted now from not getting paid, worrying about whether they can put their kid in daycare, that brings undue stress on them from what they need to do inside our prisons,” Young said.

The FBI Agents Association is blasting both sides in the shutdown.

“As the country celebrates the New Year, the American public can be assured that the FBIAA’s membership -- which includes nearly 13,000 Special Agents of the FBI -- are on the job 24-hours a day, seven days a week to protect our country from criminal and terrorist threats. These men and women are doing so while facing a confluence of policies and gridlock that are causing financial hardship for Agents and their families,"" President Tom O'Connor said in a statement.

""FBIAA members and others are currently working without pay or paid leave because of a fourth government shutdown in five years. The FBIAA calls on elected officials to work together to end the shutdown and restore Agents’ pay,"" O'Connor said.",Luke Barr,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/law-enforcement-unions-frustrated-members-missing-pay-amid/story?id=60141079,2019-01-03 22:56:32+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
218,21stcenturywire--2019-03-29--Lawyers tasked with derailing internal Syrian peace process and the failure of international justic,3/29/2019,21stcenturywire,Lawyers tasked with derailing internal Syrian peace process and the failure of ‘international justice’,"Historian John Laughland explains why the International Criminal Court’s attempt to indict President Assad of Syria reveals its dictatorial and warmongering tendencies.

The announcement that “a group of Syrian refugees and their London lawyers” have found “a neat legal trick” to press for an indictment against Syrian President Bashar Assad by the International Criminal Court demonstrates, yet again, the dangerous corruption of international justice, against which I have been warning for over a decade.

The Syrian war is nearly over, thanks to the military successes of the Syrian army and its Russian and Iranian allies. Exhaustion on both sides has probably helped. Diplomatic overtures have started to re-integrate Syria into the international system, starting at the regional level: the United Arab Emirates have re-opened their embassy in Damascus; the Sudanese president, Assad’s near namesake, Omar Al-Bashir, has visited Syria, as have senior Egyptian officials; Syrian officials have attended pan-Arab summits; even Israel is maintaining its dialogue with Russia over Syria. In short, the situation is being slowly normalised as Syria herself embarks on the painful search for internal peace.

The attempt to get Assad prosecuted is an attempt to stamp out these seedlings of peace before they take root. Any prosecution against Assad would scupper, or at least severely damage, this slow acceptance that the Syrian president is part of the solution. When even the British government has accepted that Assad is here to stay, and that peace must be made with him, his implacable enemies fear that their prize is about to slip out of their grasp. They do not want peace, if that means keeping Assad.

We know that the goal is to sabotage any peace process because this kind of indictment is old hat in international criminal law. At the end of the Bosnian Civil War in 1995, indictments were issued against the Bosnian Serb leaders, especially Radovan Karadzic, specifically in order to remove them from the Dayton peace talks. Antonio Cassese, then president of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, said in 1995, just after the indictment was issued against Karadzic, that it had been issued for that reason: “The indictment means that these gentlemen will not be able to participate in peace negotiations” (quoted in the Italian daily L’Unità, 26 July 1995). Incidentally, Cassese had himself encouraged the prosecutor to bring these prosecutions even though he, as a judge and president of the tribunal, was supposed to be neutral.

The “legal trick” is designed to overcome the fact that Syria is not a state party to the Rome statute of the International Criminal Court and therefore not subject to its jurisdiction. Assad’s enemies are seeking to sidestep the fact that Syria is beyond the ICC’s reach by seeking to apply to Syria a principle which, unfortunately, the ICC itself applied to Burma last year. In September, the ICC judges agreed that a case could be brought against Myanmar (Burma), even though that country is not a state party to the Rome statute, because the crimes it had allegedly committed – deportation – had caused people to flee into Bangladesh, which is a state party. By analogy, Syria’s enemies hope that the presence of Syrian refugees in Jordan, a state party to the ICC statute, will enable them to go after Assad. They seem not to care that this is the first time anyone has ever mentioned “deportation” in Syria, although Damascus has been accused of all manner of other crimes.

The ruling on Myanmar and Bangladesh illustrates everything that is wrong with international justice. Not only did the decision to apply jurisdiction to the Burmese authorities break the fundamental principles of international law, as expressed in the “treaty on treaties,” the 1969 Vienna Convention, which says that the principle of free consent is “universally recognized” and whose Article 34 says, “A treaty does not create either obligations or rights for a third state without its consent,” it also broke an even more fundamental principle by specifically claiming the right to define its own powers (referred to, in English texts, with the French and German expressions la compétence de la compétence and Kompetenz-Kompetenz). The Court described this as “a well-established principle of international law according to which any international tribunal has the power to determine the extent of its own jurisdiction.” In reality, it is no such thing.

On the contrary, the powers of all organisations are determined by law. Even sovereign governments are restricted by national laws in their powers. The idea that an international organisation has the legal right to determine its own powers, and to extend its jurisdiction to states that have not accepted it, is about as blatant a violation of the rule of law as one can imagine. In the past, such claims were equivalent to declarations of war, because a claim like this can only be settled by force. For example, on July 23 1914, Austria demanded the right for its police to carry out investigations inside Serbia for the assassination of the Archduke Franz-Ferdinand in Sarajevo on June 29. It sent an ultimatum to Belgrade to this effect, which Serbia refused. The result was the First World War, launched by Vienna in the name of the right to punish the perpetrators of that crime.

The ICC has already discredited itself massively after the Laurent Gbagbo fiasco. Having collaborated in the politically-motivated indictment of the president of Côte d’Ivoire in 2011 – a collaboration which gave legitimacy to the French military operation to oust him, just as it gave legitimacy to the NATO attack on Libya by also indicting Colonel Gaddafi at the same time – the Court was forced to acquit Laurent Gbagbo eight years later, in January of this year.

By seeking to extend its lamentable rule to Syria, and thereby to disrupt a barely embryonic peace there, the ICC risks destroying its reputation even further. For the rules limiting the jurisdiction of international organisations to states which have consented to accept them are not some arcane technicality of international law. Instead, they reflect the most basic principle of politics, which is that those who wield power need to be constitutionally linked to those over whom they wield it. International organisations which are not based on such consent violate that very basic principle flagrantly, and therefore start to resemble the very dictatorships they pretend to combat.",21wire,https://21stcenturywire.com/2019/03/29/lawyers-tasked-with-derailing-internal-syrian-peace-process-and-the-failure-of-international-justice/,2019-03-29 09:45:45+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
326,21stcenturywire--2019-05-10--Julian Assange The UK Sweden and the Illusion of Justice,5/10/2019,21stcenturywire,"Julian Assange: The UK, Sweden and the ‘Illusion of Justice’","Whistleblower and political prisoner Chelsea Manning has been released from Alexandria Detention Centre in the US state of Virginia.  This follows the appeal made by her lawyers that continued detention would be a violation of law as it would be to punish her and not to ‘purge her contempt’ given her principled conviction in not cooperating.  She was held in contempt in March in relation to a grand jury investigation into the highly dubious, if not fabricated charges against WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange.  She is now facing the prospect of further detention as she has been subpoenaed to a different grand jury next week and by all accounts will continue refusing to cooperate.  At the same time Assange is fighting extradition from the UK to the US where it is likely he will face degrading treatment for the politically-driven charges against him.  The US and the UK, and Sweden in the case of Assange, have abused their legal systems to create a facade of  both ‘rule of law’ and ‘freedom through choice’, behind which Assange and Manning are persecuted.

As an army intelligence analyst,  Manning leaked documents to WikiLeaks which led to the exposure of horrific war crimes by the US,  including the  Collateral Murder cockpit video of the slaughter of unarmed civilians in Iraq in 2007.   For this Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2010, commuted to 7 in 2017.  While outraged by Assange for his role in publishing leaks, the Trump government has also now gone after Manning.  Manning believes this to be about revenge, and the discrediting of truth-tellers and whistleblowers who dare hold governments to account, as she expressed in a statement just prior to release:

“I believe this grand jury seeks to undermine the integrity of public discourse with the aim of punishing those who expose any serious, ongoing, and systemic abuses of power by this government, as well as the rest of the international community. Therefore, participating in this fishing expedition – which potentially exposes other innocent people to the grand jury process – would constitute an unjustifiable and unethical action. Now, after sustaining serious psychological injury from my current confinement, I don’t wish to expose any other person to the trauma and exhaustion of civil contempt or other forms of prison or coercion.”

The personal toll this has taken on Manning is immense:

“Without committing a federal crime, and after exhaustive testimony at a trial several years ago, I am again ripped from my life by a vindictive and politically motivated investigation and prosecution.”

Manning faces continued detention because she won’t surrender.  Assange is probably still alive and fighting because he has not surrendered.  For Assange this meant that while in the Ecuadorian embassy he could only access urgent medical help by risking arrest and extradition to the US, which could have meant the death sentence or a life prison sentence.  Surrender or death.  Death or death.  The illusion of choice hid persecution.  Manning makes this very point:

The illusion Assange had a choice is also essential for the British government  to carry off that he was a criminal fugitive hiding from justice:

“…Assange is in the embassy of his own choice...”

 – Alan Duncan, Foreign Office

It is now evident that this was a lie.  Choice was an illusion for the public.  Assange would have risked the death sentence or life in prison by leaving the embassy.  This is what he could now face if extradited following his arrest on 11th April.  The British government lied.  What has now become apparent is that law is the government’s weapon of choice.

On 12th April, the day after Assange was arrested by the British police,  Labour MP Stella Creasey, with backing from over 70 MPs, wrote to the Home Secretary asking for Assange to be extradited to Sweden if its authorities re-opened the investigation into sexual allegations for which Sweden had requested Assange’s extradition in 2010.  This was based on no new claim of evidence, or due process, and could easily be seen as political interference to put pressure on the Swedish authorities.  The case itself has been condemned as trumped-up, a and violation of law.  Meanwhile, the Swedish authorities were not even  aware of the plan to arrest Assange:

“This is news to us too, and we haven’t yet processed the information…We don’t know why he has been arrested.”  – Sweden’s chief prosecutor, Ingrid Isgren

Creasey seemed to think this was about procedural oversight:

“The decision to rescind the political asylum of Mr Assange by the Ecuadorian authorities seems to have been something of which both the UK and US authorities were made aware in advance.”

How remiss of the UK government to forget the sexual allegations made by two Swedish women they seemed to care about for so many years.  Or perhaps the UK and US no longer needed the women:  extradition to the US could now be through the UK.  The sexual allegations, the initial vehicle for getting Assange to the US via Sweden, were presumably viewed as surplus to requirements on 11th April.  After years of hunting Assange on the pretext he was a ‘rapist evading justice,’ the U.K. government, like that of Sweden, a liberal champion of women’s rights, is exposed as fake,  exploiting sexual allegations for political agenda: in this case subservience to Washington’s attack on journalism and freedom of speech.

Millions were thrown at surveillance on Assange, a bounty the Crown Prosecution Service considered priceless, shown in a 2013 email to the Swedish prosecutor:

“I do not consider costs are a relevant factor in this matter.”

The statement made by  Women Against Rape in 2012 should help Creasey and Co. to understand why the British government did not notify the Swedes of Assange’s arrest but invested so much in these sexual allegations:

“Once again women’s fury and frustration at the prevalence of rape and other violence, is being used by politicians to advance their own purposes. The authorities care so little about violence against women that they manipulate rape allegations at will, usually to increase their powers, this time to facilitate Assange’s extradition or even rendition to the US.”

The illusion of ‘unavailability in the Ecuadorian embassy’

And now that Sweden has today announced it will decide next week whether to reopen the case for yet a third time, it is continuing its media circus tactics around Assange,  as previously pointed out by journalist John Pilger:

“For Assange, his only trial has been trial by media. On August 20, 2010, the Swedish police opened a “rape investigation” and immediately – and unlawfully – told the Stockholm tabloids that there was a warrant for Assange’s arrest for the “rape of two women”. This was the news that went round the world.”

Is the Swedish government creating a launching pad for reasserting itself as champion of women?  An opportunity for some face-saving for the calculated use of its prosecution services that took being dragged to the Swedish Supreme Court by Assange’s legal team before it would progress the preliminary investigation, while countless offers by both the Ecuadorian government and Assange’s lawyers for him to be interviewed were not taken up? As pointed out by former Foreign Secretary of Ecuador, Gillaume Long:

“There was no need for the Swedish authorities to delay for over 1,000 days before agreeing to carry out this interview, given that the Swedish authorities regularly question people in Britain and received permission to do so on more than 40 occasions in recent years.”

But should they decide to reopen the case, and have the case internationally scrutinised, an unlikely scenario according to Assange’s Swedish lawyer Per E Samuelson, it would mean all attention would then be on Sweden. This would remove it from the UK – convenient for the UK government to wash its hands of Assange and not be the betrayer of international law and of journalists and whistle blowers everywhere.  Sweden could take that title.

Creasey’s letter embodies the anti-human rights narrative that rejects the decision of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UNWGAD) that Assange has been subjected to arbitrary detention. It is this anti-human rights narrative the British government is using to continue persecuting Assange by keeping him in stark prison conditions after years of confinement, while he now fights extradition.

To justify sentencing him to 12 months inside high-security Belmarsh prison for skipping bail seven years ago,  the court rejected his defense of asylum, despite the risk of persecution to Assange being more obvious than ever, vindicating his asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy.   We have an anti-human rights government in power and some courts are standing in line behind it giving away their independence and integrity to serve the war criminals hunting Assange.

MPs used the withdrawal of his Ecuadorian citizenship and asylum rights, an act recognised as unconstitutional and in violation of international law, as an opportunity to extradite Assange to Sweden from where he would be extradited to the US.  Once there he would face inhumane treatment, as warned by the UN rapporteur on torture.  This was a cowardly act by the MPs.  They have undermined asylum and human rights laws,  Creasey herself being a campaigner for asylum rights in Britain.   What’s more, they exploited the emotive progressive political and feminist outrage to ride rough shod over due process for Assange, while they stayed silent on the government’s use of sexual allegations for political gain, ‘a violation of law.’  Such are the “champions of action.”

The integrity of two individuals, publisher and whistleblower, has rocked the foundations of the most powerful who thought they were untouchable.  Their resilience against the uncivilised US beast and its supine servants puts to shame our liberal ‘progressive’ politicians who daren’t stray from mainstream narratives, no matter how corrupt or fake, through fear of disapproval.

“Whatever one might make of my principles and decisions, I shall continue to make hard choices and sacrifices rather than relinquish my ethical positions in exchange for mere trinkets of personal gain or self-pleasure in the form of being released.” – Chelsea Manning

MPs should demand an investigation into:

It appears the current Trump Administration has crossed over a Constitutional red line which previous US presidents couldn’t or wouldn’t do, and which now has profound implications regarding the First Amendment.

According to former Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger:

“The Espionage Act was a panic measure enacted by Congress to clamp down on dissent or “sedition” when the US entered the First World War in 1917. In the subsequent 102 years it has never been used to prosecute a media organisation for publishing or disseminating unlawfully disclosed classified information. Nobody prosecuted under the act is permitted to offer a public interest defence.”

Despite the obvious constitutional breach, the United States Department of Justice has declared war on the practice of journalism, and are colluding with their proxies in the UK, Ecuador and Sweden to claim global jurisdiction whereby they will be able to prosecute any person on the planet for publishing documents pertaining to government war crimes and corruption. But there is hope, as media watchdog and rights groups are now pushing back against the new DOJ leveled against Assange. The debate is heating up. Watch:

 A TALE OF TWO PRISONERS: Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and right-wing personality Tommy Robinson, are being treated very differently inside HM Belmarsh Prison.

 

 Nina Cross

 21st Century Wire

Alfred de Zayas, former UN Rapporteur, has described the actions of the British authorities in pursuit of Assange as “… contrary to the rule of law and contrary to the spirit of the law.”  What we see on the surface is an illusion of British justice, masking a political agenda behind it.

Britain’s notorious Belmarsh Prison is now being presented as beacon of good governance, indicative of a fair and just society which equitable but firm with perpetrators. After carefully reviewing the case of Julian Assange though, there can be little doubt that placing the award-winning journalist in such a facility is nothing but the latest vehicle for his rendition to the US.

So far, Belmarsh has been fulfilling that state agenda.

Belmarsh as the state’s next weapon of choice

Judge Deborah Taylor sent Assange to category A Belmarsh prison for a bail-skipping offense, even though he’d demonstrated that he had good reason to skip bail.

It is difficult not to conclude that the category A assignment was done so that he would be weak and vulnerable.  In essence, Assange was sent to Belmarsh for 50 weeks for failing to turn up at a police station.  There was no ongoing court case; he had no prior offenses; there were no charges; the Swedish investigation had been dropped.  So skipping police bail was all the British government had. It should also be pointed out that Judge Taylor made a series of mistakes during the sentencing on 1st May, referring to rape charges in Sweden, which Assange corrected and which she then acknowledged were wrong.  This indicates that Judge Taylor went into court at least uninformed, set in her mind that Assange had somewhere, somehow been charged with rape. This would seem to explain some of the reasoning behind Judge Taylor’s cruel sentencing, described by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention as ‘disproportionate’ but also as furthering the arbitrary deprivation of Assange’s liberty.  What’s more, it has been pointed out how several thousand people in the UK skip bail each year and are in now way subject to such harsh punishment.

Clearly, Judge Taylor had used narratives provided by the state in order to send Assange to a category A penitentiary, even though these narratives have been thoroughly debunked.  One of the false story lines promulgated by the British state and its mainstream media adjuncts, was that Swedish authorities had dropped its sex allegations case against Assange because it ‘could not progress with it’ while he was holed-up in the Ecuadorian embassy in London.  This piece of disinformation was false, shown by the fact that Swedish authorities had already carried out no less than 44 video link or in-person interviews with persons of interest and thus were more than capable of interviewing Assange too.

As for the case itself, the question has now become: what case?  Opened then shut, then opened again, then shut, then opened, and yet – Sweden’s office of Public Prosecutions still said at the time that, ‘an interview is not on the cards’.

Not surprisingly then, Swedish authorities appear to be leaving the case hanging, as they have for years.  With the Swedish courts having recently thwarted the prosecutor’s attempts to extradite him to Sweden, is the reopened case now simply a crowd control tactic?  Perhaps they have opened it for a third time because closing the books permanently on the increasingly disingenuous ‘rapist’ narrative risks attracting increased support from those members of the public (and the government) who had been previously unsure about whether Assange was entitled to any moral support.  We wait to see when the Swedish prosecutor might decide whether a ‘interview is on the cards’ after hanging the label of rapist over Assange for nearly a decade already.

And so with all the might the British establishment could muster behind a police bail skipping offence, it has Assange trapped inside Belmarsh prison.

On cue, HM Belmarsh Prison’s high security regime has so far proved crippling for Assange’s hopes of mounting a legal defence.  It is now public knowledge that government officials at Belmarsh have imposed restrictions which effectively deny Assange sufficient legal visits, deny him the ability to speak to his US lawyers, deny him access to and possession of legal documents, and deny him the basic means through which to prepare for his legal defence, namely, a laptop computer.

For those readers who may not be versed in legalese, the following points passages will demonstrate how one can measure Belmarsh’s treatment of Assange against recognised protections and guidelines, such as:

Article 6.3 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which is of particular significance for prisoners (Assange clearly qualifies a political prisoner) and states that detainees must:

“… have adequate time and facilities for the preparation of their defence…”

The Council of Europe (CoE) has produced a definition of what this means in a guide on Article 6 of the ECHR:

NOTE: During Assange’s US extradition court hearing in June, Assange himself was adamant that he had not even received the text of the US indictment against him and said that he had to have essential legal documents posted to him. His legal team also reiterated that preparation for his defense was being impeded and that access to their client was being restricted by the British government. It is difficult to argue that this strategy is not intentional.

The CoE human rights guidelines have also set out in its European Prison Rules that:

23.6    Prisoners shall have access to, or be allowed to keep in their possession, documents relating to their legal proceedings.

“A person facing criminal charges must have the time and facilities to prepare a defence. This right exists at all stages of the proceedings and encompasses the right to documents, files, and information as well as a guarantee of confidential communication with counsel.”

In May 2019, Nils Melzer, UN Rapporteur on Torture, reported that Assange had restricted access to legal documents in his cell.

More recently award-winning journalist John Pilger also reported how Assange was not permitted access to documents to prepare his defence:

In regard to Assange’s request for a laptop computer, the UK’s  Access to Justice guidelines shows this is a reasonable request and Assange’s case would seem to encapsulate the exact conditions covered by it:

“The guidance does say that laptops should be given to people who could not prepare for their case properly without it, but should not be given if it would just make things more convenient.”

The CoE’s guide on Article 6.3 also legitimises the request:

Following his assessment of Assange in May inside Belmarsh prison, Nils Melzer issued a statement detailing the conditions of dentention. Melzer was accompanied by two medical experts who specialize in the examination of possible victims of torture as well as the documentation of symptoms, both physical and psychological.  On examining Assange Melzer observed the following:

“Most importantly, in addition to physical ailments, Mr. Assange showed all symptoms typical for prolonged exposure to psychological torture, including extreme stress, chronic anxiety and intense psychological trauma.“

In addition to these concerns, reports also indicate Assange is being medicated.

Melzer has also explained that the piling-up of multiple legal proceedings is adding to Assange’s stress and inability to cope with the demands of preparing for his defence. Watch:

.

 It is important to note that Assange’s legal preparations in this case have nothing to do with the spurious bail skipping charges for which Assange was initially apprehended and detained by the British government. Rather, his legal defence involves fighting what could become a defining legal precedent for this generation – an US extradition case where a non-US citizen faces charges under Espionage Act of 1917 for his role (as a journalist) in disclosing war crimes and crimes against humanity by the US government – all published by a non-US media outlet. Therefore, it can be rightly argued that by restricting Assange’s access to a proper legal defence in such a high-profile and historic case, the British government is acting against the public interest, not only domestically, but internationally as well.

Despite all this, Belmarsh appears to have ignored or dismissed concerns about Assange’s inability to access the courts for his defence and is denying him “facilities.”

Belmarsh’s restrictions on Assange’s ability to meet his lawyers, and its refusal to allow him to speak to his US lawyers would seem to undermine the very basis of Article 6, which, according to the CoE guide:

“… guarantees the right of an accused to participate effectively in a criminal trial.”

In recognition of Article 6, the UK government website provides guidance on the right of all prisoners to contact their lawyer:

“Prisoners have rights, including … being able to get in contact with a solicitor.”

Prisoners’ rights are also supported by the UK’s own Citizen’s Advice Bureau (CAB), which provides an advisory service to all prisoners.  The following summarises prisoners’ rights in the particular areas where Assange has requested access to justice but has been denied or restricted such access by Belmarsh.  These are as follows (emphasis added):

It becomes clear, therefore, that Assange is being denied prisoner rights regarding access to justice.  The result of these restrictions on Assange is that he cannot effectively participate in the legal proceedings against him.  Belmarsh’s current restrictions appear to undermine all of his attempts to access each and every avenue of justice, as well as the means required to participate in his legal defence since the time he entered the prison. Such infringements of rights and denial of access to justice are often blamed on shortages, system problems and inefficiencies, and even justified by security and institutional practice. However, all of the British system’s shortcomings in this case could easily be avoided or corrected by prison officials.

In Assange’s case it means his legal team is forced to waste time and resources attempting to gain legal access to justice, including possibly taking legal action against Belmarsh and the British government. It is easy to imagine why authorities are quite happy for that to happen: it’s eating into the time, is draining his legal team’s resources, and causing more litigation to pile up.  There are only so many battles that can be fought; Assange’s appeal against the Belmarsh bail jumping sentence has already been dropped. And while certain restrictions will be less harsh while Assange is likely to be on remand fighting extradition, common sense tells us that the impact of the restrictions in place before then will be highly detrimental to his defence.

‘Access to justice’ has been described by the ECHR as:

“Access to justice enables individuals to protect themselves against infringements of their rights, to remedy civil wrongs, to hold executive power accountable and to defend themselves in criminal proceedings.  It is an important element of the rule of law…”

If we believe that barriers to Assange’s ability to defend himself against extradition are justified on the criteria given by a ‘overstretched and underfunded’ high-security prison system, then we are merely consenting to the erosion of law and accepting in its place rules imposed by the administrators of the state’s institutions – at the expense of an individual’s liberty. These justifications for denying Assange his basic legal right to justice are convenient pretexts for Belmarsh which, on cue, has been co-opted by a political agenda which seeks to enable his rendition to the US.

Double Standards: the Belmarsh ‘prison experience’ according to the governor

Belmarsh is also the state’s prison of choice for Tommy Robinson (real name Stephen Yaxley-Lennon), the controversial right-wing personality and founder of the English Defence League.  Robinson was convicted for breaching contempt of court laws for streaming the trial of a sex trafficking grooming gang on Facebook Live outside Leeds court in 2018, and was later convicted as a civil prisoner.



 IMAGE: Robinson famously entered the prison wearing a T-shirt which reads, “Convicted of journalism.”

Unlike Assange who was placed within the general prison population before being placed in healthcare, Robinson’s special placement appears to fall within the Belmarsh category of prisoner who is “requiring specific management arrangements because of their public and media profile” and thus has been isolated from all other prisoners.  As a result, he is held in the high security unit inside Belmarsh.  Civil prisoners are treated the same as convicted prisoners  with some exceptions, one of these being greater visiting rights.  According to one of his recent visitors, Ezra Levant, head of the Canada-based media outlet The Rebel Media, which Robinson has been employed by, he is receiving visitors three or four times a week. Levant also stated that the prison governor, Rob Davis OBE, visits Robinson daily, noting that,

“.. the governor of the prison, the warden as we call it in North America, actually visits him every day even, just for a moment just to say ‘how’s it going.’ I thought that was very interesting. Not only is the is the warden making himself available to Tommy but he’s inspecting to make sure things are well done. I found that very interesting and relieving.”

Another visitor from The Rebel Media, Jessica Swietoniowski, reported that Robinson is allowed to make unlimited phone calls between 9am and 11am each morning, stating:

“… from 9:00 until 11:00 he can be out of his cell, so his cell opens from 9:00 in the morning until 11:00, 11:00 [he] gets back into the cell. So during that time he can exercise and pretty much make as many phone calls as he wants, which is good news.”

It should be noted here that Robinson’s ability to have unfettered access to phone calls is likely because he is a civil prisoner. However, it does demonstrate the gulf in access to resources from one prisoner to the next, and what relatively little facilities Assange is allowed in comparison while attempting to prepare for his legal defence.

Swietoniowski also said that Belmarsh’s governor had “made it an exception for me” to visit Robinson during a Friday August 15th morning visitation session, and that the prison governor was working with “us” (The Rebel Media) to ensure their visits to Belmarsh as “positive as possible.”   This is explained in The Rebel’s ‘prison reports‘ which document their visits to Belmarsh.

It should also be noted that if the governor has made a decision to make a special exception for a media outlet which has employed Robinson and that can reach Robinson’s followers – it is bound to result in positive public relations for Belmarsh, and any by extension any British government officials involved in the process.  Perhaps it is hoped that Belmarsh’s efforts to be supportive might resonate with his followers and help to appease threats of unrest feared by the government. Likewise, in the eyes of Robinson’s right-wing support base, Belmarsh’s overall positive treatment of Robinson could reflect positively on the new Tory government and cabinet led by Boris Johnson as Parliament heads towards a coming general election. It is reasonable to regard this as a likely outcome of the governor’s publicly supportive treatment of Robinson.

Are we seeing the state, through Belmarsh, attempting to placate the followers of one individual while another is denied access to justice?  Is this the guileful agenda now being played out through a politicised prison system?

The stark contrast between the prison’s treatment of two high-profile figures, Robinson and Assange, is certainly evident. While Robinson is being treated fairly and lawfully, Assange is not.

According to John Pilger, the prison governor had also failed to respond to the letter sent by Assange’s lawyer, Gareth Peirce, on 4th June, roughly three months ago, about restrictions placed on Assange’s legal access entitlements.

All the indications strongly suggest that the British state through Belmarsh, seem to be imposing a lawless regime upon Assange, who finds himself yet again fighting for his basic human rights and due process in Britain.",Nina Cross,https://21stcenturywire.com/2019/08/28/julian-assange-deprivation-of-justice-and-double-standards-in-belmarsh-prison/,2019-08-28 14:02:23+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

889,abcnews--2019-01-07--As Supreme Court returns will Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg take her seat,1/7/2019,abcnews,"As Supreme Court returns, will Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg take her seat?","Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, recovering from surgery to remove two cancerous legions from her left lung, has never missed a day of oral arguments in her 25-year career on the high court bench.

On Monday court-watchers will learn if Ginsburg's record will continue unbroken.

The justices will convene their first public session of the year to hear arguments in two cases. It is not clear whether Ginsburg will take her seat beside the chief justice. Monday's oral arguments come 17 days after surgeons at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City performed a pulmonary lobectomy on Ginsburg, cutting out cancerous tissue in her lung.

The court said last month that doctors found no evidence of any remaining disease and planned no further treatment. Ginsburg spent four days in the hospital following the procedure and spent the remainder of the court’s winter recess recovering at home.

The court’s oldest justice at 85, Ginsburg has shown dogged determination to participate in the court's proceedings over the years, despite three serious bouts of cancer, several other health scares and personal setbacks, including the death of her husband in 2010.

In just the past two months, Ginsburg was hospitalized twice –- first after suffering broken ribs from a fall in her office in November, then the December surgery to remove tumors –- nevertheless participating, uninterrupted, in court business, a spokesperson for the court said.

On Nov. 9, two days after being treated for the broken ribs, Ginsburg was unable to attend the formal investiture ceremony for Justice Brett Kavanaugh but did participate in conference while working from home, a court spokeswoman said at the time.

Doctors contacted by ABC News said Ginsburg's resilience is an example for all Americans facing a cancer diagnosis.

“Lung cancer suffers from pessimism, stigma, nihilism, but here’s a patient where lung cancer was caught early,” said Dr. Geoff Oxnard, a thoracic oncologist at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. “There is room for hope.

937,abcnews--2019-01-09--Former Guantanamo Bay commander indicted for obstructing justice in 2015 death,1/9/2019,abcnews,Former Guantanamo Bay commander indicted for obstructing justice in 2015 death,"The former commander of the Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay has been indicted on federal charges of obstruction of justice related to the January, 2015 death of a base employee who had confronted the officer with allegations that he was having an affair with his wife. Christopher Tur was found drowned in the waters of Guantanamo Bay two days after confronting Captain John Nettleton about the alleged affair.

Nettleton was arraigned Wednesday at the federal courthouse in Jacksonville, Florida exactly four years to the day that Tur disappeared following the confrontation and subsequent fight between the two men.

At the time, Nettleton was the commander of Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Nettleton’s command did not include the detention facility at the base that is overseen by a one-star flag or general officer. Tur was a civilian employee of the commissary on the base.

According to the indictment, on the night of January 9, 2015 Tur confronted and yelled at Nettleton at a party at the Officers’ Club with allegations that the Naval officer had had an affair with his wife, Lara.

A short time later Tur went to Nettleton’s nearby residence and the two men engaged in a physical altercation that left Tur injured.

Investigators found texts from Nettleson's daughter, the only other person in the residence at the time, describing a loud commotion in the house. When she went to investigate she saw an unknown man hovering above her father, who was lying on the floor, attempting to use a cellphone.

The person that Tur phoned told investigators that Tur had told him he was ""at the Skipper's house"" and ""just knocked out the Skipper.""

Nettleson's daughter's texts described loud arguing and fighting that lasted for another half hour.

The next day Navy personnel went looking for Tur after he had not returned home.

Tur's body was found on January 11 floating in Guantanamo Bay after an intensive search at the base.

An autopsy determined he had drowned but had suffered fractured ribs and a laceration on his head.

From the moment the search for Nettlson began and throughout the subsequent investigation he did not mention to base personnel, investigators or his superior officer that Tur had last been seen at his home. He falsely claimed that he had last ween Tur at the Officers Club.

He also did not disclose that Tur had accused him of engaging in an affair with his wife, engaged in a physical fight at his home and that Tur had been injured.

Investigators later determined through DNA testing that blood stains found at Nettleson's home belonged to Tur. They also determined that Nettleson and Lara Tur had engaged in an affair in 2014.

Three weeks after Tur's disappearance Nettleson was relieved of command and placed in an administrative job in Jacksonville pending the results of a joint Naval Criminal Investigative Division and Justice Department investigation.

ABC News cited a U.S. official who said information had come to light during the investigation into Tur’s death that led the Navy to relieve Nettleton of command. The official said the investigation found that Nettleton had allegedly been having an affair with Tur’s wife Lara, the director of the Fleet and Family Services Center at the base.",Luis Martinez,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/guantanamo-bay-commander-indicted-obstructing-justice-2015-death/story?id=60268299,2019-01-09 23:34:46+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In November, Ginsburg was hospitalized after suffering fractured ribs from a fall in her office at the court. Tests done during that trip to the hospital led to the incidental discovery of the nodules on her lung, which were removed in December.

She was discharged less than a week after the pulmonary lobectomy, which she underwent at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, and was home on Christmas Day.

She didn't attend oral arguments immediately following the surgery, marking the first time she missed a scheduled public session due to illness in her career over a quarter of a decade on the high court bench, a court spokeswoman said.

1562,abcnews--2019-03-11--2 Department of Justice officials dispute double standard over Mueller documents,3/11/2019,abcnews,2 Department of Justice officials dispute 'double standard' over Mueller documents,"Two senior Justice Department officials are privately dismissing claims by House Democrats that refusing to share special counsel Robert Mueller's final report and other investigative materials with Congress would amount to a ""double standard.""

The circumstances that led the Justice Department to disclose investigative information in other recent, high-profile cases now being cited by Democrats are ""just not the same"" as the circumstances surrounding the Mueller probe, one senior department official insisted to ABC News, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about it.

That official and another high-ranking Justice Department insider both pointed to what they see as one big difference: former FBI director James Comey.

In past cases, the officials alleged, Comey's public statements undercut the Justice Department's ability to argue that certain investigative materials should remain private. And, they said, the department only shared documents when investigations were finished or couldn't be impacted by the release of those documents.

Long-standing department policy prohibits the disclosure of information that could influence ongoing probes or harm people who haven't been charged.

But powerful Democrats in Congress worry the Trump administration could stretch that policy to execute ""a cover up,"" as the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., recently put it. And two weeks ago, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., accused the Justice Department of a ""double standard"" for turning over ""substantial amounts of investigative material"" when Republicans were in control of Congress last year and the year before.

In fact, the Justice Department gave lawmakers access to 880,000 pages of documents related to the FBI investigation of Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she served as secretary of State. And the Justice Department offered lawmakers access to a wide array of documents from the FBI's investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign, including information related to Americans targeted in the probe.

In a letter to Attorney General Bill Barr three weeks ago, Nadler, Schiff and the Democratic chairs of four other House committees insisted that ""precedent"" leads them to ""expect"" access to Mueller's report and other investigative material. On Friday, they introduced a congressional resolution reiterating their stance.

Democrats fear that even if Mueller fails to find evidence of criminal wrongdoing, he could find evidence of misconduct that the public might never see.

""People are entitled to know it, and Congress is entitled to know it,"" Nadler told ABC News last week. ""It's our job to hold the president accountable.""

But two weeks ago, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein assailed what he called the ""knee-jerk reaction"" calling on the government to share its secrets.

""If we aren't prepared to prove our case beyond a reasonable doubt in court, then we have no business making allegations against American citizens,"" Rosenstein said.

In May 2017, just days before Comey's firing, Rosenstein wrote a letter to Trump blasting Comey for publicly airing criticisms of Clinton a year earlier.

On July 5, 2016, inside FBI headquarters, Comey announced that — even though Clinton and her aides shouldn’t be charged — they were ""extremely careless"" in handling classified information. For 15 minutes, Comey detailed what his team found and contemplated.

Without those public comments, the Justice Department could have withheld documents on the basis that they reflected internal deliberations. But ""from the get-go we had a very, very weak litigating position because"" Comey had in effect waived that privilege, one senior Justice Department official said.

In addition, the Clinton email probe was ""over and closed"" when lawmakers were granted access to materials, the other official noted.

Asked whether the Justice Department would share what Mueller found about allegations of obstruction of justice — since that inquiry would likely be closed when Mueller issues his report — the officials declined to answer.

Nevertheless, in Mueller's case there are ongoing investigations and prosecutions to still protect, the officials said.

""The tentacles of [Mueller's probe] are going to continue being investigated for some unforeseen period of time in the future,"" according to one official. ""[And] we do not give over to the Hill any material that could negatively impact an ongoing investigation.""

That didn’t stop the Justice Department, however, from disclosing pivotal materials from the FBI’s Russia probe while Mueller’s investigation was underway.

When Republicans were accusing the FBI of abusing the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to target President Donald Trump's associates, dozens of lawmakers were eventually granted access to four top-secret FISA applications, which after being approved by a federal court allowed the FBI to intercept the communications of former Trump adviser Carter Page, who at the time was suspected of being a Russian spy.

Key lawmakers were also able to review thousands of pages of internal emails and other classified materials.

Those accommodations ""potentially"" provide Democrats with their best argument to gain access to Mueller’s findings, the two Justice Department officials acknowledged to ABC News.

But — once again — the officials blamed Comey for opening the door for Congress, saying his public statements on the Russia probe had ""a lot"" to do with their decisions.

In early 2017, Comey took the rare step of publicly confirming the FBI launched an investigation into Trump's associates and reviewed the so-called ""dossier,"" which by then had been published online by news outlets and detailed allegations against Page that were ultimately included in the FISA applications.

Then, in coordination with the White House, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., drafted and released a memo citing substantial portions of the FISA applications.

So two months later, based on what had already become public, the Justice Department made what it called the ""extraordinary"" decision to let the entire House and Senate intelligence committees review the FISA applications.

""[But] we really didn't give them the keys to the kingdom,"" one of the officials said.

In fact, the Justice Department did refuse to comply with several Russia-related requests. And in a letter to Congress at the time, Rosenstein said the ""voluminous"" production of documents was done ""in a manner that does not harm the integrity of any ongoing investigation.""

In Mueller's probe, the department will similarly ""protect the integrity of ongoing investigations"" and ""apply"" privileges when appropriate, the two Justice Department officials told ABC News.

""We have to actually pick our battles, which we're going to do,"" one of them said.

Mueller could send his final report to Barr in the coming days. It is not expected to detail the findings of spin-off investigations that Mueller referred to prosecutors around the country to pursue separately.

Henry West, of Schofield, appeared Friday in court, where his cash bond was set at $10 million.

West, 64, is charged with one count of first-degree intentional homicide, 11 counts of attempted first-degree intentional homicide, one count of arson, three counts of attempted arson and resisting or obstructing an officer, the Wausau Daily Herald reported.

Authorities say he opened fire Oct. 3 at Pine Grove Cemetery in Wausau. Patty Grimm, the 52-year-old cemetery manager, was killed and two other people were wounded.

Police say West was fired from the cemetery in 2012.

Two days before the shooting and fire, a judge ordered West evicted from his apartment, according to court records.

According to the criminal complaint, when police entered West's apartment after the attack, they found a toaster plugged into a timer sitting next to a container of what appeared to be oil. Another toaster in the apartment was stationed next to a container of gasoline, the complaint said. Police also found two other 1 gallon (3.79 liter) jugs of gasoline and several other containers of incendiary liquids in the home.

According to prosecutors, West also set an explosive trap in a house next to his apartment building that could have killed as many as 100 people if it had detonated.

About 15 minutes before the shootings, a fire broke out in a garage at West's apartment complex, which was less than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) from the cemetery.

While emergency crews were investigating the garage fire, they responded to a gas leak at a vacant home next door. Police said they also found primitive explosive devices there while ventilating the house.

Had it ignited, the gas leak would have been enough to kill up to 100 people, including police, nearby residents and anyone at neighboring businesses, according to the complaint.

West is due back in court Nov. 21. His public defender did not immediately reply to a phone message from The Associated Press on Friday seeking comment on West's behalf.",,https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/charges-cemetery-killer-booby-trapped-home-target-police-66378352,"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 17:56:27 -0400","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The kill team’s leader, Maher Mutreb, and other members, had apparently been trained by the US government in the past.

It’s a familiar story, heard often enough when the US aligns itself with a country with a flimsy human rights record. The trainees were part of ongoing routine training operations meant to increase the ties of rank-and-file Saudi figures with the US security state.

During his training Mutreb, a colonel in the Saudi spy agency, apparently went so far as to try to befriend Khashoggi, likely gathering more intelligence on him, but likely also making his murder all the more uncomfortable.

While the Trump Administration has time and again shrugged off Khashoggi’s murder as not worth risks to US-Saudi ties, and business relationships, Congress doesn’t feel that way at all. This new revelation is almost certain to add to Congressional calls to further stem ties with the Saudi government, specifically so US training and equipment aren’t involved in routine atrocities such as this.",Activist Post,https://www.activistpost.com/2019/04/several-of-jamal-khashoggis-killers-were-trained-in-united-states.html,2019-04-02 01:22:20+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The serial killing suspect is accused of smothering older women before robbing jewelry and other items around the DFW area.

Originally, on December 3, 2017, Diane Delahunt was found dead at Preston Place Senior Living Apartments in Plano. Three rings were missing from her fingers although police informed her family that she died of natural causes.

Trending: Pope Francis Unveils Globalist New World Religion at Summit with United Nations Leader

However, Delahunt’s cause of death changed in July 2019 to “undetermined” and her daughter claims police recently told her that serial murder suspect Billy Chemirmir was responsible for killing her.

take our poll - story continues below

Delahunt’s death is the 20th linked to Chemirmir. Two other women survived Chemirmir’s attacks in Frisco and Plano.

The illegal alien was indicted on 12 counts of capital murder in Dallas and Collin counties and two counts of attempted capital murder. In addition to Delahunty, eight more North Texas families stated that police suspect Chemirmir killed their loved ones.

Chemirmir is maintaining his innocence and is currently in the Dallas County Jail with a $16.2 million bail. In one Dallas County case, he faces the death penalty.

Lori Delahunty stated she found her mother lying dead on the floor of her apartment two years ago. She noticed a large knot on her mother’s head, but Lori Delahunty did not suspect foul play at the time. Originally, police told her the death was allegedly due to natural causes — a heart attack or stroke. Lori Delahunty originally thought that maybe her mother hit her head before falling.

After the attack, Lori Delahunty tried looking for the three rings — an engagement ring, a wedding ring and a 50th anniversary gold band — and then filed an insurance claim after failing to find them.

A few months later, she learned from other residents at Preston Place that police were investigating deaths and thefts there. Additionally, she learned about the case of a woman surviving an attack by a man who tried to suffocate her and stole her jewelry.

Lori Delahunty called Plano police in March 2018 and they informed her that her mother was “on the list”, which surprised her.

At that time, she learned about Chemirmir and the list of people he had been accused of murdering between May 2016 and March 2018.

Chemirmir was arrested back in March 2018 after another woman at Preston Place survived an attack. She provided a description of the assailant to police, who identified Chemirmir and proceeded to wait for him at his Far North Dallas apartment the next day.

After Chemirmir was apprehended, police across North Texas started investigating into reported deaths and looked for more potential victims.

Madni Ahmed, 20, repeatedly knifed the 86-year-old at her home in Aubrey Road, Small Heath, where he had also stabbed her grandson as he slept.

The crazed killer, of Cavendish Road, Stoke on Trent, launched the frenzied and motiveless attack after buying knives online using his brother's ID.

He was found guilty of murder, attempted murder, being in possession of an offensive weapon and affray after a trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

Ahmed smirked as was sentenced to life in prison today, where the judge set a minimum term of 36 years.

He stabbed Riasat Bi’s 18-year-old grandson 15 times as he slept in the front room of the family home, before fatally stabbing Mrs Bi and leaving her with more than 25 injuries on the morning of July 12.

He then continued upstairs where he was met by another grandson who ordered him to leave before grabbing a knife in self-defence. Ahmed refused to leave and following a scuffle he received a slash wound to his arm.

The killer fled the house via the attic window, ditching his knife in the roof guttering before jumping into a neighbour’s garden.

Ahmed’s blood was later found on the fence panels as he stumbled through the garden and into a neighbour’s house, grabbing a knife from the kitchen.

He made his way down Coventry Road before ditching his blood soaked clothes on Malmesbury Road. He had called a taxi to collect him from The Akers Trust to take him back to a hostel in Newtown.

However, later that evening, Ahmed was arrested at a hospital in Stoke-on-Trent after detectives traced the phone he had been using throughout the day.

The court heard Ahmed's own father had gone to police to say his son could have been involved after hearing about the murder and seeing Whatsapp footage of the killer leaving the scene.

Speaking after the case, Miss Bi's daughter - who asked not to be named - told how the tragedy had 'devastated' the close-knit family.

She said: ""My mom had three children and six grandchildren - the youngest is only four.

""We have tried to stay strong and positive for the children - we want them to know whatever they are going through we will be there for them.

""I was so very close to my mom - I saw her every day.

""She was so gentle and kind and had no enemies - she was loved by everyone.

""She wasn't just our mom - she was a mom to so many other people.

""She didn't have a bad bone, she loved and cared for everyone she met.""

Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, from Force CID, said: “This was a pre-meditated attack, with Ahmed intent on killing someone that day by taking a knife to the home of an elderly lady.

“Ahmed claimed that he was looking for someone at the address and when he couldn’t find who he was looking for, he attacked Riasat’s grandson while he was sleeping, leaving him with life changing injuries. He then went on to carry out a horrifying attack on a defenceless elderly lady.

“This was a horrendous and violent attack and although no sentence will ever compensate for what Ahmed has caused this family, I hope they can find some closure in that justice has been served today.""",birminghammail,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/smirking-killer-small-heath-grandma-15663480,2019-01-11 12:39:27+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Madni Ahmed was caught on camera drawing a 'rambo' knife from his trousers before stabbing Riasat Bi to death and knifing her grandson as he slept at her house in Aubery Road, Small Heath on July 12 last year.

The crazed killer, of Cavendish Road, Stoke on Trent, launched the frenzied and motiveless attacks after buying knives online using his brother's ID.

Ahmed, 20, was sentenced to life in prison and ordered to serve a minimum term of 36 years today (January 11).

Now, chilling CCTV footage - capturing the tragic moments before Mrs Bi's death - has been released by West Midlands Police.

It shows as the remorseless killer casually dons a pair of plastic gloves while heading towards Riasat's home.

Ahmed is then shown calmly trying to enter the property using a side entrance, but fails.

He walks back towards the house and instead creeps in through an open front door - pulling the huge 'rambo' knife from his trouser pocket as he steps inside.

There, he stabbed Riasat Bi’s 18-year-old grandson 15 times as he slept in the front room of the family home, before fatally knifing her.

She was left with more than 25 injuries after the horrific attack.

54789,birminghammail--2019-01-20--Convicted killer who murdered his wife and baby is son to be proud of,1/20/2019,birminghammail,Convicted killer who murdered his wife and baby is 'son to be proud of',"The father of a man sentenced to spend the rest of his life in a US prison for killing his wife and baby said: “He is a son to be proud of.”

Cliff Entwistle and wife Yvonne remain convinced their son is innocent, and have carried out an investigation into the evidence that jailed him.

Former computer programmer Neil Entwistle, 40, lived in Redditch before moving with wife Rachel to Carver, Massachusetts.

He was convicted of the deaths in June 2008, and sentenced to life imprisonment with no chance of parole.

His father, a councillor in Bassetlaw, Nottinghamshire, said: “He is holding up.”

The case against Entwistle seems compelling. He was in the family home at the time of the deaths and flew back to England, with the intention of seeing his parents Cliff and Yvonne, hours after the crime.

He was arrested on the London Underground in February 2006, and voluntarily extradited to America.

His father, however, remains adamant the case against his son is flawed, and the legal process tainted.

He is furious a book on the case, which made legal headlines, was on sale on the very day the trial began, and painted the defendant as a cold-blooded murderer.

Neil’s decision to fly to England was a “normal reaction”, Cliff insists. He was in a state of shock and his first thought was to come home.

Cliff has now written his own book, Neil’s Story: Trial by Media, in a bid to prove his son’s innocence.

Publicity for the work states: “With remarkable objectivity, Cliff Entwistle reveals the inconsistencies in the investigation, the lies told and the key forensic evidence withheld from the medical examiner, and with touchingly personal candour, he shares the pain he felt at the great loss and betrayal his family suffered.”

Entwistle met future wife Rachel Souza, an American studying abroad, while on an electronic engineering course at York University.

They married in 2003, then moved to Redditch, where Rachel taught English, drama and theatre studies at St Augustine’s Catholic High School.

After moving to the States in 2005, they stayed with Rachel’s mother and step-father before getting their own home in Hopkinton, Massachusetts.

The bodies of 27-year-old Rachel and daughter Lillian, aged only nine months, were found in the rented property’s main bedroom on January 22, 2006. The mum had been shot in the head, her daughter in the stomach .

Entwistle became a suspect after his DNA was discovered on the handle of a .22 handgun owned by his father-in-law, and Rachel’s DNA was on the muzzle.

Middlesex County district attorney Martha Coakley told a packed press conference: “With a firearm we believe he had secured at some time before that from father-in-law Joseph Materazzo, he shot Rachel Entwistle in the head and then proceeded to shoot baby Lillian, who was lying on the bed next to her mother.

“We believe possibly this was intended to be a murder-suicide, but we cannot confirm that. Obviously the murder was effected, but the suicide was not.

“We believe Neil Entwistle returned the gun to his father-in-law’s home in Carver, then made preparations to leave the country. As we know, he was observed at Logan International Airport (in Boston).

“He purchased a one-way ticket on British Airways at approximately 5am on Saturday morning, January 22.

""He was on an 8.15am flight to the UK on that day. Based upon forensic information that linked the .22 handgun owned by Joseph Materazzo both to Neil Entwistle and to Rachel, we believed we had probable cause to seek a warrant for Neil Entwistle’s arrest.”

Entwistle was convicted on June 25, 2008 , a local newspaper the Metrowest Daily News describing the verdict as a “foregone conclusion”. The prosecution made much of his interest in swingers’ sites and financial problems.

The court was told that, just four days before the murders, his user-name was used to search the web for the best way to kill someone.

Rachel’s mother Priscilla Mattarazzo said at the sentencing: “Our dreams as a parent and grandparent have been shattered by the shameful, selfish act of one person.

“For him to have to hide behind the accusation of murder-suicide of this beautiful woman and perfect mother is low and despicable.

“We were sentenced without the luxury of a trial by jury and now must go on with the eternity of emptiness.”

The murdered woman’s stepfather, Joe, looked Entwistle in the eye and said, slowly and deliberately: “Neil, you have been judged today by a jury of your peers on Earth, but one day, you will face the ultimate judgment of your horrific deeds and betrayals.”

An immediate appeal by Entwistle was rejected by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.

He still protests his innocence, backed to the hilt by his father, a former miner, despite shifts in the interpretation of events that day.

Entwistle told detectives, during a recorded call Massachusetts detectives made to his parents’ home in Worksop, that he had returned home from an errand at 11am and discovered the two bodies. He covered them with a blanket, but did not contact the police.

He informed cops he was so distraught he intended to commit suicide, but, unable to end it all, flew home.

He rushed upstairs to discover Lillian dead and Rachel ready to shoot herself in the head.

Before the double killing, there had been clear signs Rachel was suffering from post natal depression, he says.

“This gun was never conclusively proved to be the murder weapon,” he says.

“And we all know DNA can be transferred.

“ There are many things wrong with this case, but there is no-one out there who has the guts to say this, apart from ourselves.

“What the media never portrayed, is that we had lost – and Neil had lost – a beautiful granddaughter and daughter.”

Two years ago, Cliff told his local newspaper, the Worksop Guardian: “I just don’t understand why this wasn’t brought up in court at all.

“I remember one occurrence when Yvonne and I were speaking to her on the phone and she asked if we had received photos of Lillian from Christmas that she had posted over.

“When we replied that we hadn’t, she put the phone down and, according to Neil, ran upstairs sobbing.

""She had been having problems since Lillian was born.”

Entwistle, despite initially claiming he was out when the crime took place, used the same defence in a pen-pal letter written behind bars.

He wrote: “The truth is we can never truly know what goes through a person’s mind at such moments.

“When I think back, I still wonder what went through Lilly’s mind, nine months old though she was, as she yelled out in pain.

“Was she calling for her daddy to come and help?

“Even Rachel, as her eyes met mine before she fired that fatal shot, seemed to be saying something, though she uttered not a word.”

Cliff believes a piece of “crucial forensic evidence” underlines the fact a terrible miscarriage of justice has taken place, and proves his son did not commit murder.

At the 2008 trial, Dr William Zane, the man who carried out the post-mortem examination on Rachel, said he did not know gunshot residue had been found on both sides of the woman’s hands.

“This was hard cold evidence according to Neil’s defense attorneys,” Cliff maintains.

“No such evidence has ever been found to prove that Neil committed this crime.

“Withholding this evidence is perverting the course of justice. As soon as the revelation was revealed in trial the judge should have dissolved the case against Neil.

""The medical examiner in the trial admitted on the stand he would have wanted to know of this information if it was available to him.”

Dr Zane, however, did not see the revelation as significant. He said in court: “It only tells me she was in a room where a gun was fired.”

Shortly after his incarceration, he was tricked by white supremacists at Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center, in Lancaser, Massachusetts, the Boston Herald reported.

Fearing death threats from black gangs, he agreed to shave his head in exchange for protection from the right-wing extremists.

But once he’d taken a Bic-issue razor to his bonce, the Brit was told: “It’s a nice gesture on your part but we’re gonna kill you, too.”

One prison officer told the Globe: “He seems to have been very easily manipulated.“

The non-white inmates were threatening him, calling him a baby-killer. He apparently asked: ‘How do you distinguish who belongs to your group and who doesn’t?’

“The white inmates eventually convinced him the only way he was going to have any safety was if he joined up with them.”

Entwistle was later placed in protective custody, then transferred to a medium security prison in Bridgewater, Massachusetts.

“With his wife and baby daughter found dead in their bedroom, Neil was the immediate suspect, and his subsequent conviction seemed inevitable to all who heard and read the sordid coverage.

“However, things are not always what they seem.

“You will be disturbed by the harrowing details he exposes of the justice systems of both the UK and the US, yet you cannot fail to be encouraged as he testifies to the strength and resilience of family bonds in the face of unimaginable heartache and adversity.”",Mike Lockley,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/convicted-killer-who-murdered-wife-15687488,2019-01-20 05:30:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jack Shepherd, 31, is still on the run after he was sentenced to six years imprisonment for manslaughter by gross negligence in his absence last summer, after vanishing before his Old Bailey trial.

Ms Brown, 24, was killed after the boat he had bought to ""pull women"" flipped into the icy waters of the River Thames during her champagne-fuelled first date with Shepherd in December 2015.

Her father, Graham Brown, mother Roz Wickens and sister Katie, will meet Sajid Javid on Tuesday to seek assurances that everything possible is being done to bring on-the-run Shepherd to justice.

Mr Brown said: ""Jack Shepherd has stolen a beautiful life and needs to atone for his crass and reckless actions.

""If it wasn't for this our lovely Charlotte would still be here.

""We want to hear from the Home Secretary on what action is being taken to bring Shepherd to justice.

""We also want to know that this operation will be fully resourced until he is found and put behind bars.""

The family will ask Mr Javid what action has been taken so far, what current lines of inquiry are open and about the resources available to police, including through the National Crime Agency (NCA).

They also want to know what can be done to obtain digital forensic evidence from web designer Shepherd's contact with his lawyer, which could help to pinpoint his location.

Shepherd's solicitor Richard Egan has previously denied ""protecting a fugitive"" despite helping him to appeal against his conviction while on the run from the law.

In December, he was given permission to challenge his conviction, sparking an outpouring of public anger, with Ms Brown's family accusing Shepherd of making a mockery of justice.

Since then, uncorroborated theories about Shepherd's whereabouts have included Turkey, Thailand and Georgia.

Ms Brown's family's meeting with the Home Secretary in the House of Commons was arranged by Communities Secretary James Brokenshire, their local MP for Old Bexley and Sidcup

""In seeking this meeting for the family I want to ensure that the full efforts of our law enforcement agencies are being used to arrest Shepherd,"" he said.

""It is unacceptable that Charlotte's family still have not seen the justice they rightly deserve.

""There can be no hiding place for this man and we must be utterly resolute in seeing that Shepherd pays for his crime.""",birminghammail,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/family-speedboat-crash-victim-demand-15711612,2019-01-22 06:43:59+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55051,birminghammail--2019-01-23--Birmingham mum jailed for 12 years for throwing boiling water over convicted killer,1/23/2019,birminghammail,Birmingham mum jailed for 12 years for throwing boiling water over convicted killer,"A Birmingham mum who threw boiling water over a convicted prisoner has been jailed for 12 years.

Natalie Roberts attacked Josie Hollis while they were both on remand at HMP Foston Hall in Derbyshire.

Her trial at Derby Crown Court in December was told how there had been tensions between them on the wing where they were both based.

Roberts was a serving prisoner while Hollis was awaiting trial on charges of murder and robbery.

Hollis said in the build-up to the kettle incident Roberts, of Broughton Road, Handsworth, had “constantly abused” her in “social” areas of the jail such as the canteen.

She said moments before it happened she had been supporting another inmate who was being verbally abused by a third prisoner.

It was then that Roberts called out “murderer”.

Hollis, who later admitted to the manslaughter of a Sheffield man, went into the defendant’s cell to confront her.

The 35-year-old then threw the freshly-boiled water over her.

When Roberts was found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent, she shouted to the jury that convicted her she would “kill herself and come back to haunt them” .

According to Derbyshire Live, she has now told a probation officer she “wishes she had killed the b***h” referring to throwing the water over Miss Hollis.

Sentencing Roberts, Recorder David Mason QC said: “This was a horrendous offence which has left Miss Hollis with permanent scarring to the left side of her body.

“You tried to pour a kettle full of boiling water over her head which I believe shows an intention to cause even more serious injuries than those you did.

Three men, David Osborne, 51, Ieuan Harley, 23, and Darran Evesham, 47, are on trial accused of murdering David Gaut, 54, by stabbing him over 150 times after learning he had killed a child.

Neighbour Kyle Alford said he first met Mr Gaut, known as Dai, when he moved into his block of flats in Long Row, New Tredegar, Caerphilly, south Wales, just six weeks before his death.

""He said he had been released from prison for serving 33 years for killing a soldier, at first,"" he told Newport Crown Court.

Mr Alford said he and his partner Samantha Jenkins became suspicious of their new neighbour and began to search the internet.

Hours before Mr Gaut was killed on August 2 last year, they learnt he had in fact been jailed for murdering 15-month-old Chi Ming Shek in 1985.

The pair told other neighbours, including Osborne, what they had learnt.

""It was almost as if Ozzy didn't believe it and didn't seem too bothered. He made a comment that Ieuan would probably want to cut him up and put him down the plughole,"" Mr Alford said.

""Ieuan was shocked and angry. He had been drinking and under the influence, or coming down, from amphetamine. He said he had been taking amphetamine.

""He was annoyed, calling him things like a 'dirty f*****' and saying, 'He wasn't even a child, he was a baby'.""

Ms Jenkins told the jury it took some time to discover the truth about Mr Gaut.

""We were spelling his name wrong and it came up in Ozzy's and we were in shock when it came up,"" she said.

""Ozzy said he would text him about films or something. Ieuan said Ozzy can get him round here and Ozzy can hide in the kitchen.""

Mr Alford and his partner returned to their flat and a short time later they sent a text message to Osborne, saying: ""Don't let Dai know we all know he's a baby killer. Catch the FK. N out. Dirty nonce c***. WA""

Prosecutors allege Mr Gaut was stabbed over 150 times after being lured to Osborne's flat by the three defendants.

His fingernails were also cut off and after his death the three men dragged his body back to his own flat.

The following day Harley went to Mr Alford's flat with half a leg of lamb he had stolen from Morrisons and they chatted about Mr Gaut.

Ms Jenkins said: ""Kyle said, 'It's terrible about what we learnt about Dai' and Ieuan said, 'Don't worry about him, you won't be seeing him again'.""

Osborne, from Long Row, Elliots Town, New Tredegar; Harley, of no fixed address, and Evesham, from Powell's Terrace, New Tredegar, all deny the murder of Mr Gaut, between August 1 and August 4 last year.

55519,birminghammail--2019-01-28--Familys heartbreaking words as killer neighbour John Nixon sentenced to 15 years,1/28/2019,birminghammail,Family's heartbreaking words as killer neighbour John Nixon sentenced to 15 years,"""No sentence will ever be the right result, we’ll never get justice,"" were the words issued as friends and family of tragic murder victim Reece Hipwood streamed out of a packed courtroom.

The popular 28-year-old - described as a ""proper lad"" by those who knew him - was killed after a drunken row with his next-door neighbour, John Nixon.

Mechanic Nixon, aged 54, stabbed Mr Hipwood seven times during a fight at his home in Sandmere Road in the early hours of July 15 last year.

Mr Hipwood, whom Nixon described as being like a son to him, ran upstairs and attempted to defend himself with a vacuum cleaner.

Nixon, though, proceeded to attack Mr Hipwood and stabbed him repeatedly with a large kitchen knife, with one blow measuring 12 centimetres.

The stabbing was witnessed by Nixon's 11-year-old son as his partner, Leigh-Anna Hunt, wrestled the blade from his grasp and immediately called for an ambulance.

Despite heroic efforts by police and paramedics, Mr Hipwood suffered a cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead just after 2am.

At Birmingham Crown Court today (MON), Nixon - who appeared emotionless in the dock - was sentenced to life and will serve a minimum of 15 years behind bars.

Judge Inman branded the murder as ""an utterly senseless killing"" as both sets of relatives and friends remained calm in - and outside - the courtroom.

Upon leaving the court after sentencing, Mr Hipwood's heartbroken fiancée Bethany Tonry was comforted by around 20 or so family members.

Speaking to BirminghamLive at the end of the trial, a relative of Mr Hipwood said: ""No sentence will ever be the right result, we’ll never get justice.

""We don’t get to see [Reece] ever again.""

The victim's fiancée, Miss Tonry, had dreams of family life together with Mr Hipwood after moving into their home in Sandmere Road.

In a statement, Miss Tonry said: ""Reece was a really bubbly person. Full of life. He truly was the life and soul of the party.

""It was our home and the place we had decided to start a family.

""Sadly, our future was ripped apart and shattered.

""He had many passions in life.

""My whole life has changed. I have lost the person I intended to spend the rest of my life with.

""We were always together, especially at night.

""I have had to have a significant time off work. I cannot believe that someone who with whom he had a good relationship with took his life.""

The victim's father, Jonathan Hipwood said: ""Our world has been turned upside down. Our hearts have been smashed to smithereens.

""It is painful to know that the person who took his life still has a future.

""We cannot celebrate any more. We are not a complete family any more.

""There will be no wedding of Reece and Beth to celebrate.

""We have pictures of Reece around our house keeping his memory alive.

""It is hard to even talk about. None of us sleep properly.

""We feel like zombies going through the normal motions of life.

""It all comes back, the heartache.""

Speaking after Monday's sentencing, Detective Inspector Caroline Corfield, from the force’s homicide unit, said: ""Nixon got into such an uncontrollable drunken rage that he carried out a horrifically violent attack in front of his own wife and son.

""There is no doubt that both men were drunk and had been fighting with one another, but the final attack on Reece had no justification.

""Reece was unarmed and completely unprepared to defend himself against Nixon’s frenzied assault with a knife.

""Our thoughts are with Reece’s family and we can only hope that justice being served on Nixon will give them some kind of closure and help them to come to terms with their loss.""

Reece’s family spoke of their loss following the verdict.

They said: ""As a family - Reece’s mother, father, fiancée and sisters - we are happy that justice has been done for the loss of our son Reece, both for us and for Reece’s friends.

""We would like to take the opportunity to thank the paramedics and ambulance service for their efforts that tragic night, Adrian Keeling QC for prosecuting the case, the police and their family liaison officers, and Victim Support for their help through this process.""",Ashley Preece,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/familys-heartbreaking-words-killer-neighbour-15744043,2019-01-28 17:02:03+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55586,birminghammail--2019-01-29--Bloodstained clothing linked by DNA to murdered child killer David Gaut trial told,1/29/2019,birminghammail,"Bloodstained clothing linked by DNA to murdered child killer David Gaut, trial told","Bloodstained clothing found dumped in a plastic bag matched the DNA of a child killer who was allegedly murdered by three men, a court has heard.

David Gaut, 54, was allegedly lured to his death and stabbed 150 times in August at a block of flats in New Tredegar, Caerphilly, South Wales.

David Osborne, 51, Ieuan Harley, 23, and Darran Evesham, 47, are on trial accused of murdering Mr Gaut after learning he had served more than 32 years in prison for murdering toddler Chi Ming Shek in 1985.

Newport Crown Court on Tuesday heard there was a ""one in one billion"" chance that blood found on clothes stuffed in a B&M bag on a riverbank did not belong to Mr Gaut or a member of his family.

Prosecutors had earlier alleged the defendants were caught on CCTV before Mr Gaut's death wearing clothes matching those that were found.

Forensic scientist Martin Beale was taken by prosecutor Ben Douglas-Jones QC through the items, which included a heavily bloodstained T-shirt, tracksuit bottoms, a pair of socks and underwear.

Mr Beale said the white T-shirt displaying the logo Jamaica Brand Cannabis was found ""saturated"" in blood.

He said: ""There was heavy contact bloodstaining noted to the front right side. Some of this was smeared and diluted. Blood spots were also noted.""

Mr Beale said the smearing occurred after ""a degree of force was applied to wet blood"".

He added: ""The chances of (blood) being from someone other than David Gaut or someone related to him are one in one billion.""

He also said components of DNA found also matched Harley.

Mr Beale showed the jury the T-shirt and a pair of bloodstained grey Everlast tracksuit bottoms.

He said: ""I expect the T-shirt and jogging bottoms would have been worn at the same time, because of the blood pattern.""

Mr Beale said the ""sheer quantity of blood"" found on the pair of black FCUK underpants led him to believe they were worn underneath the jogging bottoms.

Last week the jury was shown CCTV of Osborne and Evesham walking near the riverbank following Mr Gaut's death.

The court previously heard Mr Gaut claimed he had been jailed for killing a soldier when he moved next door to Osborne, six weeks before his death.

Suspicious neighbours found out his past as a child killer by searching the internet, and prosecutors allege the three defendants then ""lured"" him to Osborne's flat where he was murdered.

Mr Gaut was stabbed more than 150 times while still alive, and a further 26 times after he died, and his fingernails were also cut off post-mortem.

Osborne, from Long Row, Elliots Town, New Tredegar; Harley, of no fixed address; and Evesham, from Powell's Terrace, New Tredegar, all deny the murder of Mr Gaut between August 1 and 4 last year.

Joshua Marshall, aka 'Hecki', made the boast about Tobijah Thompson, also known as 'Tiny', in a video posted on Instagram.

The 18-year-old was on a night out with friends when they were brutally attacked in the early hours of Mother’s Day 2015.

Daniel later died of his injuries having been stabbed in the neck.

Thompson was handed a life sentence at Warwick Crown Court in April 2016 and will serve a minimum of 32 years.

Marshall himself is serving a six-year jail sentence for slashing a 17-year-old across the face with a knife after the teenager refused to hand over his phone.

The 22-year-old, from Bordesley Green, left his victim permanently scared.

Marshall was sentenced at Birmingham Crown Court in April 2015 after being found guilty of wounding and possessing an offensive weapon.

It's not clear where the video was recorded.

A source told BirminghamLive: ""It's absolutely disgusting. Daniel's family are lovely and these are dangerous people.

""Tobijah Thompson is going for an appeal and this video is saying he's not sorry.

""Shouldn't that be bought to the attention of the parole board?""

In the video, Marshall says: ""My brother cut a body and told me he's not sorry""

The rapper also makes it clear he has spoken to his fellow prisoner.

Over a hip hop beat, he continues: ""In that system I hear many n***** fold, so it's good to hear him smile up on that prison phone.

""Now it's process of appeals, God knows how that goes, but that's progress for real.

""I hope that he gets it, if he don't that's a different road.

""Probably be 58 when he sees parole.

""He went jail 25 so do the maths.""

Marshall also raps that he and his jailed friend ""started from the bottom"", going from ""handguns to shottys"".

Tompson brandished a knife during an altercation at the former Society nightclub in Coventry and stabbed Daniel in the neck.

The teenager collapsed on the pavement outside and died in an ambulance while on the way to hospital.

The horrific attack, which was caught on CCTV and shown to a jury at Warwick Crown Court during the trial, also saw Thompson injure three of Daniel’s friends who were in the club that night.

Innocent victim Elizabeth Roberts, an 80-year-old grandmother, was fatally injured when a BMW careered the wrong way down a road and smashed into a Ford Fiesta in which she was a passenger.

It happened after the BMW was chased for eight miles by a Volkswagen Jetta following an incident involving another Fiesta.

The BMW and the VW collided in Gaydon, Warwickshire , before the BMW went the wrong way along the B4451, causing the crash in which Mrs Roberts died.

After a two-week trial, defendants Naqash Hussain, 29, of Prescott Avenue, Banbury, and Sagar Taseem, 26, of Evenlode, Banbury, were found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving.

They were jailed for 12 years each at Warwick Crown Court.

A third man, Samuel Franklin, 24, of Warkworth Close, Banbury, pleaded guilty to the same charge in June 2018 and was sentenced on Tuesday, February 5 to six years.

And a fourth, Kieran Flint, 21 of Barley Hill, Culworth, Northamptonshire, was cleared of dangerous driving but convicted of careless driving.

He was fined £500 and given six penalty points.

The crash happened on February 15, 2017 and the incident started in Banbury.

The court heard the BMW, containing Taseem and Hussain, had been involved in an incident with Flint's Ford Fiesta.

The BMW was then chased by the Jetta, driven by Franklin.

Both vehicles collided and shortly afterwards the BMW turned around and drove the wrong way along the B4451 into oncoming traffic, where it collided with the Fiesta Mrs Roberts was travelling in.

The Jetta then turned around and drove back to the scene of the collision, where Franklin chased the occupants of the BMW away.

The occupants of the Fiesta were taken to hospital with serious injuries but Mrs Roberts died the next morning.

Following the sentencing, Det Con Stephen Barr from Warwickshire Police said: “This was a tragic incident to investigate, which ultimately could have been avoided.

“I hope the sentencing sends out a clear message that we will not tolerate dangerous driving on our roads, and will ensure those who disregard the law will be investigated and punished for their actions.”

The family of Mrs Roberts added: “We would like to thank the emergency services and the members of the public who came to assist on the night of the collision and the medical team at University Hospital Coventry & Warwickshire.

“We would also like to thank Warwickshire Police who have worked tirelessly to bring the offenders to justice.

David Gaut, 54, was allegedly lured to his death and stabbed 150 times in August at a block of flats in New Tredegar, Caerphilly, South Wales.

On Wednesday David Osborne, 51, one of three men accused of carrying out the killing, said he was in his kitchen when he heard Mr Gaut screaming for help when fellow defendant Ieuan Harley, 23, attacked him with a knife.

Osborne said: ""I could hear some arguing and shouting.

""Then I heard Harley turn around and call David a paedophile.

""It sounded like a knife going into flesh and someone being stabbed.

""I could hear David shouting out 'help' and heard him screaming. I felt scared.

""I didn't want to go into the lounge because it sounded horrible.""

Osborne said he eventually entered his lounge to find Harley holding a bloodied knife in his hand and while standing over Mr Gaut's body.

He described how Harley, whose clothes were covered in blood, then allegedly knelt down on his knees and began ""prodding"" Mr Gaut's body, gesturing a stabbing motion with his hand to judge Mr Justice Clive Lewis.

Osborne said he asked Harley ""What the hell have you done in my flat?"" to which Harley replied: ""Don't worry, we'll clean it all up.""

He said he chose not to call the police and instead go on a ""drinking spree"", saying: ""It was done. The police were going to come anyway.""

Osborne said he and Harley moved Mr Gaut's body to his passageway and used bleach to clean up blood, and about 30 minutes later they were joined by the third defendant, Darran Evesham, 47, who arrived ""drunk"" and carried on drinking at the flat.

Osborne said later all three wore socks on their hands as they ""carried and dragged"" Mr Gaut's body next door back to his own flat.

Newport Crown Court had earlier been told Harley called Mr Gaut a ""nonce"" after finding out he had served more than 32 years in prison for murdering toddler Chi Ming Shek in 1985.

Harley allegedly told Osborne: ""He doesn't deserve to be here.""

Mr Gaut had moved next door to Osborne six weeks before the three defendants allegedly ""lured"" Mr Gaut to Osborne's flat where he was murdered after they found out about his conviction.

Tanesha Melbourne-Blake, who mentored younger teenagers to keep them off the streets, was gunned down in Tottenham, north London, on April 2 last year.

Detectives revealed on Wednesday they believe her killer was the passenger in a silver or grey Vauxhall Meriva that was found burnt-out in Barnet five days later.

No-one has been charged over her death, and in an emotionally-charged interview on Wednesday family friend Akin Akintola said her loved ones need answers.

""Everyone that knows Tanesha needs an answer. Who did this? Why? We urge people to come forward if they know anything, just come forward,"" he said.

""No-one will come to terms with what's happened. No-one could come to terms with what's happened.""

Tanesha, who was killed 13 weeks before her 18th birthday, had planned to travel to Jamaica to visit her father and was due to start a youth work course last autumn.

Her mother said in a statement: ""Myself and Tanesha were best friends as well as mother and daughter.

""The impact of her death is long lasting and still doesn't feel real. It feels as if I'm living in a dream and she'll be coming back.

""The impact on her dad and siblings has been indescribable too. There is a huge hole in our family that will never be filled. As a family we only ask if anyone does have any information, then please come forward. We would not wish what we are going through on any other family.""

The teenager, who had seven siblings, died during a spate of bloodshed in London last year.

On the same night, Amaan Shakoor, 16, was shot dead in a separate attack in Walthamstow.

On Wednesday, her family released new childhood pictures of her at anti-gun and knife crime events to coincide with renewed police appeals. 

 Mr Akintola said she had helped to keep younger people away from crime.

""In the centre Tanesha was one of the people that brought everyone in,"" he said. ""No matter where you come from, so you're not hanging on the streets, you're not getting into trouble, you're not doing anything negative. She brought everyone in.

""Since the loss of Tanesha, you can see the atmosphere in the place has changed. It's had a very big impact on the service as a whole. It's had a very big impact on the staff that work there. So many people, her friends, her family. It's just been terrible.""

He recalled hearing the anguished screams of her mother on the night she died.

""Everyone was there, just waiting on one side of the road. Me and another colleague we walked, you know you're just pacing up and down the road just praying, and I heard Tanesha's mum scream.

""She screamed out loud. We could hear from where we were standing, that's how we knew that she had lost her life.""

Detective Inspector Beverley Kofi said she is sure someone in the community knows the identity of the killer.

She said: ""Tanesha was an innocent young girl; she had no gang affiliations whatsoever. Her life was cut tragically short by the senseless actions of a group of people who were intent on committing violence that night.

""Tanesha's death has left her family completely devastated. Her loss is not only felt by them but by her friends and the wider community in Tottenham, many of whom are young people who she helped to steer them away from violence.

56299,birminghammail--2019-02-07--Reward of 10k posted to trace the killers of David Danger Currier,2/7/2019,birminghammail,Reward of £10k posted to trace the killers of David 'Danger' Currier,"A £10,000 reward has been posted in a bid to trace the killers of Bromsgrove dad David 'Danger' Currier - ten years after he was stabbed to death.

West Mercia Police have today issued a fresh appeal 10 years on from his unsolved murder.

A reward of £10,000 is available for information passed to Crimestoppers that leads to the arrest and conviction of those responsible. 

   

 Mr Currier, aged 35 and originally from Stirchley, was murdered at his home on Birmingham Road, Bromsgrove, during the early hours of February 7 2009.

He had suffered a fatal stab wound to his leg. 

   

 At the time of his murder his young son, who was only six years old, was present at the address and was found there alone when officers arrived. 

   

 West Mercia Police Major Investigation Unit are currently reviewing this ""cold case"" investigation and renewing their appeal for information.

Police are hoping that the tenth anniversary of Mr Currier's murder will result in vital new information being provided.

Mr Currier was more commonly known amongst friends by his nickname 'Danger.' 

   

 When police attended the property on Birmingham Road and discovered his body, there were signs of forced entry to the premises and a disturbance. There was also clear evidence indicating that several people had been present around the time of his murder. 

   

 Witnesses reported seeing a white Ford transit van and a dark red hatch-back car, possibly a Hyundai, in the area of Birmingham Road and School Lane.

Four men were also seen standing beside both vehicles close to the entrance of what was formerly 'The Mount School' (now KeyOstas) before walking along Birmingham Road in the direction of Mr Currier's house.



   

 His family continue to hope that those responsible for his murder will be found and his brother, Nick Barry, urged anyone with information to come forward.



   

 Detective Inspector Mark Walters, from West Mercia Police, said: ""Officers continue to investigate this tragic death and remain committed to the investigation.

""Everyone who contacts Crimestoppers stays 100% anonymous. 

   

 ""I am confident there are people out there who know the identity of those responsible for David's murder and encourage anyone who may have any information, no matter how small or insignificant they may feel it is, to please come forward. 

   

 ""The investigation team are particularly keen to speak to anyone who may have seen the white coloured transit van or dark red hatch-back car on or near to Birmingham Road and/or School Lane around the time of the incident. 

   

 ""Our thoughts remain with the family of David Currier who continue to suffer from their loss 10 years on and in particular his son, who tragically lost his father at such a young age.""

56337,birminghammail--2019-02-08--Convicted killer Andrew Wallace who killed and dismembered mum Julie Reilly jailed,2/8/2019,birminghammail,Convicted killer Andrew Wallace who killed and dismembered mum Julie Reilly jailed,"A family have urged a convicted killer who murdered a vulnerable woman and dismembered her body to tell them where the rest of her remains are.

Andrew Wallace, 42, was jailed for life and ordered to serve at least 28 years behind bars after admitting the murder of Julie Reilly.

He murdered the 47-year-old at her flat in the Govan area of Glasgow in February 2018 and then cut off her legs with a knife before disposing of her remains.

Her femur bones were found at two separate locations in the city but the rest of her body has not been recovered.

Wallace pleaded guilty to murder and attempting to defeat the ends of justice at an earlier court hearing.

Judge Lady Rae sentenced Wallace to life imprisonment when he appeared at the High Court in Glasgow on Friday and said he must serve 28 years before he is eligible to apply for parole.

She said: ""You are, in my view, a dangerous man who has a considerable propensity for violence.""

Following the sentencing Lynne Bryce, Julie's sister, said on behalf of the family: ""Please tell us where Julie is. Let my Mum have her wee girl back. Let her first grandchild have somewhere to go and grieve for Julie.

""I hope that if he (Wallace) has a heart he could now please tell us where he put my sister and let her come home to be put to rest properly.""

She also thanked police for their work in solving the case.

The court heard that Wallace moved in with Ms Reilly in December 2017 after splitting up with his girlfriend.

Ms Reilly, a mother of four, had suffered a brain injury in 2016 which left her with memory problems and slow reactions.

Wallace told a friend she was easy to manipulate and rip-off and in January texted a friend asking ""do you know how to assassinate a stalker?""

Between 1pm and 2pm on the afternoon of February 7 Wallace met a friend in the street and told him ""I've murdered a c***, I need to get rid of a body"".

Prosecutor Richard Goddard told the court that the following day Wallace told his friend Edward Glover that Ms Reilly had moved away and he moved in with him.

Mr Goddard said: ""The accused told Glover he'd been out in a friend's car and they had hit a deer and were intending to sell the meat.

""On the afternoon of February 10 the accused arrived back at the flat and was dragging a big suitcase from the back into Glover's flat. It seemed to be heavy. The accused said it contained meat from the deer. In fact it contained part of Julie Reilly's body.

""At some point in the night the accused left the flat and took the suitcase with him.""

On 11 February Wallace arrived at another friend's flat with a suitcase which he put in the shower, telling his friend it contained his dirty washing when in fact it contained part of the remains of his victim.

Ms Reilly was reported missing in mid-February after she failed to pick up her prescription at the pharmacists, and family members raised concerns.

On April 19 a member of the public called police to say he could see what appeared to be a bone with flesh attached to it in his front garden at Ardshiel Road in Govan.

It was recovered by officers and DNA testing confirmed it was Ms Reilly's right femur.

Mr Goddard told the court that on April 23 another member of the public went to the police station to report finding what appeared to be a burial site containing ""fleshy material"".

The site was excavated and remains were recovered which were confirmed to be Ms Reilly's other femur.

A post-mortem examination could not ascertain the cause of death.

Forensic scientists examined Ms Reilly's flat in Shieldhall Road and, using a substance called luminol which shows up blood staining, found large areas of blood and drag marks in the property.

The court heard that Wallace was convicted of culpable homicide in 1992 and sentenced to ten years in jail and had other previous convictions for violence.

Lady Rae asked Ian Duguid QC, representing Wallace, whether his client would co-operate with police to recover the rest of Ms Reilly's names.

He said his client was ""prepared to entertain an approach from the police"" once the court case is over but his client would say nothing further.",James Rodger,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/convicted-killer-andrew-wallace-who-15804534,2019-02-08 21:50:29+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56351,birminghammail--2019-02-08--Gay Village serial killer sentenced to life in prison for gruesome murders,2/8/2019,birminghammail,Gay Village serial killer sentenced to life in prison for gruesome murders,"A Canadian judge has sentenced ""warped"" serial killer Bruce McArthur to life in prison with no chance of parole for 25 years.

McArthur pleaded guilty last week to eight counts of first-degree murder. 

 The 67-year-old former landscaper sexually assaulted, killed and dismembered men he met in Toronto's Gay Village district over seven years.

Justice John McMahon called McArthur a sexual predator who killed for his own ""warped, sick gratification"" and said the victims suffered slow and painful deaths.

He called their dismemberments ""pure evil"", but said the guilty plea spared a jury four months of graphic and gruesome evidence that would have probably required counselling after.

Prosecutor Craig Harper had asked for a parole ineligibility period of 50 years, when McArthur would have been 116.

The judge said that would have only been symbolic. McArthur will be eligible for parole when he is 91.

McArthur - who is pictured in the tweet below - has been in prison since January last year when investigators discovered dismembered remains in planters at home he used as storage for his business.



 He also staged photos of some of his victims after they died, posing corpses in fur coats and putting cigars in their mouths. McArthur accessed some of the photos long after the killings.

The victims fit a pattern: Most were of Middle Eastern or south Asian descent and lived on the margins of Canadian society, and their disappearances attracted little attention.

One victim hid the fact that he was gay from his Muslim family, another was a recent immigrant with a drug problem, a third was a refugee who was ordered deported, and another victim was homeless, smoked crack cocaine and worked as a prostitute.

Many of Toronto's LGBQT community said for years a serial killer was at work.

The prosecution said a frequent site of the killings was McArthur's bedroom and he repeatedly strangled his victims either with his hands or with rope and a metal bar.

The killings took place from 2010 to 2017.

Criminal experts say it is unusual for someone to become a serial killer later in life, but the prosecution said there is no evidence of earlier murders.",David Bentley,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/world-news/gay-village-serial-killer-sentenced-15804473,2019-02-08 21:02:11+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Artur Waszkiewicz told his trial he had been a heroin addict since the age of 18, which the prosecution proved to be his motive for robbing the elderly widow.

Addressing Waszkiewicz's previous convictions, Chief Crown Prosecutor for the CPS in the East Midlands, Janine Smith, said: ""He did have a propensity for dishonesty.

""He had a number of previous convictions and they were primarily for dishonesty, primarily for shop theft.""

Ms Smith continued: ""The thing about this case is if you look at the defendant's behaviour before and after - that is what we could put in front of the jury.

""We knew he was trying to borrow money, we knew he was trying to sell his dog - all to go towards drugs.

""After the offence he changed his appearance and cancelled the insurance policy on his car.

""We would say they help to build a picture which we can put to the jury.""

Questioned on what she believed led to Waszkiewicz's conviction, Ms Smith said: ""I really do believe it is a combination.

""His vehicle being in close proximity very shortly before the offence, the fact you can see the brake lights on his car and the fact that you can see his fingerprints on a receipt in the bag.

""He is the one who had the motive. He is the one, by his own admission, who had a heroin addiction.""

Speaking of Waszkiewicz's desperation for drugs, Ms Smith said: ""I think it is a clear aggravating feature of the offence and we would say that he has targeted someone who is vulnerable.""",James Rodger,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/how-receipt-100-year-old-15826409,2019-02-13 15:56:48+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56724,birminghammail--2019-02-13--Murdered schoolgirl Alesha MacPhails dad sold drugs to alleged killer,2/13/2019,birminghammail,Murdered schoolgirl Alesha MacPhail's dad 'sold drugs to alleged killer',"The father of murdered six-year-old Alesha MacPhail sold cannabis to the teenager accused of killing her, a court has heard.

Robert MacPhail, 26, told the High Court in Glasgow he had done deals with the 16-year-old.

The schoolgirl was found dead in woodland in July last year on the Isle of Bute.

She had been spending a summer break with her father and grandparents in the house they shared.

The accused, who cannot be named because of his age, denies taking her from her bed before raping and murdering her on July 2 last year.

Alesha's father identified him in the courtroom and told the jury: ""I used to sell him cannabis.""

Mr MacPhail, who is unemployed, said he had last sold him the drug a few months before Alesha's murder.

He said he stopped after the teenager's mother told his partner, Toni McLachlan, to stop.

The court heard the deals usually took place at a bus shelter across from his own mother's house in Ardbeg Road, where he then lived along with Ms McLachlan, 18.

The pair were in bed on the morning of July 2 when Alesha's grandparents came in to say she was missing, and all four began hunting around the house and outside for the schoolgirl.

Mr MacPhail said he had put his daughter to bed the night before with a Peppa Pig DVD.

""I told her I would see her in the morning and that was the last time I saw her,"" he said.

Mr MacPhail said his relationship with Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire, had broken down months after she was born.

He said he saw his daughter every second weekend and during the holidays.

Mr MacPhail said his daughter ""loved"" spending time on his home island, going to the beach and playing at the park.

Asked about Alesha's relationship with Ms McLachlan, he said it was ""great"".

""They both loved each other to bits,"" he said.

The 16-year-old accused of Alesha's murder has lodged a special defence blaming Ms McLachlan for her death.

He also denies attempting to defeat the ends of justice by disposing of clothing and a knife.

Alesha's grandfather Calum MacPhail, 49, described the desperate search after they realised she was not in her bed.

He said: ""We searched under all the beds, in all the wardrobes to see if she had crawled away somewhere.

""There was no sign of her anywhere. I threw some clothes on and went outside.""

After driving around, looking for Alesha at the park and the putting green, he later saw police had cordoned off an area and was told to go to Rothesay police station with the rest of the family.

Visibly distressed, he said: ""We were all put into a room and about five minutes later a police officer came in and said 'we found her but she's passed""'.

Alesha's grandmother Angela King, 47, had made a call to the police at 6.23am, around 10 minutes after realising she was not in her bed.

In the call played to the jury, she continued to check cupboards as she told the handler: ""We've looked all through the house and she's nowhere to be seen.""

Her partner had earlier told the court that the key to the lock on the front door of the top-floor flat was often left in the door during the day to allow family members to come and go.

He said: ""In Rothesay a lot of people leave their door unlocked.""

Ms King said the key was still in the door when she went to bed in the early hours of July 2.

She said: ""The key was in the lock and I'd forgotten to take the key back out of the door.""",James Rodger,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/murdered-schoolgirl-alesha-macphails-dad-15822476,2019-02-13 08:04:46+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
57320,birminghammail--2019-02-22--Police reveal how they caught teen killer who raped 14yr old Viktorija Sokolova,2/22/2019,birminghammail,Police reveal how they caught teen killer who raped 14yr old Viktorija Sokolova,"Detectives have lifted the lid on how they solved a crime which ""shocked"" a community.

A teenage boy has been given a 19-year sentence today for the rape and murder of 14-year-old Viktorija Sokolova in West Park, Wolverhampton in April last year.

The schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was just 16 when he arranged to meet Viktorija on the night of Wednesday 11 April after several Facebook Messenger exchanges.

The following morning Viktorija’s body was found by a dog walker, semi-naked and bent over a park bench. She had been brutally raped and bludgeoned with a weapon, possibly a hammer, causing massive head injuries and a fractured spine.

Detective Inspector Caroline Corfield, from the force’s homicide unit, said: ""It was clear that the scene of Viktorija’s attack was a large wooden pavilion near to the boating lake, known locally as the ‘black house’. Her blood-stained baseball cap and earrings were found there and also, horrifically, three of her teeth which points to the violence of the attack. Her body had then been dragged to a bench some 150 metres away, where she was found.

""We also found footprints in Viktorija’s blood on the floor in the pavilion, the pattern of which were identified as those of Adidas Gazelle trainers, the same footwear later seen worn by the killer as he walked to and from the park.""

DI Corfield continued: ""The murder of Viktorija shocked the local community and the wider general public, not least because of the ages of those involved.

""As many young teens do, Viktorija was testing boundaries and could be wilful, but she was a popular girl and had the love and support of her family and friends. She certainly had her whole life ahead of her, but sadly that was brutally cut short.

""I am so proud of everyone who worked incredibly hard on this deeply distressing case. Nothing can compensate for the loss of Viktorija and her family have been put through an unimaginable ordeal. Our thoughts remain with them.""

A judge at Wolverhampton Crown Court told the teen he must serve at least 19 years in prison before he will be eligible to apply for parole. He was sentenced to an additional 10 years for rape to run concurrently.

Following his conviction in December, Viktorija’s mother and stepfather spoke of their loss. They said: ""We were a family, now there are only two of us. Viktorija will never be replaced and will always be missed dearly. She will remain in our hearts forever. We will never be given the opportunity to have grandchildren because this has been taken from us.""

Viktorija had moved to the UK from Lithuania in 2011, and was with friends on the evening of her death when she arranged to meet her killer later that night. Although they advised her not to go, Vikorija assured them he was a friend and left at 10.40pm. Sadly they did not see her alive again.

CCTV showed the teenager walk from Bright Street towards the Kingsland Road entrance of West Park. He was seen again, wearing distinctive Adidas trainers, leaving the park around two hours later.

57855,birminghammail--2019-03-12--Killer drivers jailed after horror smash leaves cyclist dead,3/12/2019,birminghammail,Killer drivers jailed after horror smash leaves cyclist dead,"Two motorists who killed a cyclist near Halesowen after driving carelessly have been jailed and banned from getting behind the wheel.

Worcester Crown Court heard that Balvinder Sangha, aged 46, and 21-year-old Emily Wilkinson were both arrested after the fatal three-vehicle smash in Bromsgrove Road on Thursday, June 15 in 2017.

Father-of-two Ross Fawthrop was cycling past the Swallow's Nest pub when the two cars – Sangha’s Transit van and Wilkinson’s Corsa – collided and crashed with his bike at around 7.40am.

The 59-year-old sadly died at the scene, according to medics.

Following an eight day trial at Worcester Crown Court, both defendants were found guilty of death by careless driving on Monday, March 11.

Sangha - of Romsley, Halesowen - was sentenced to twelve months in prison with a three-year driving ban and Wilkinson - of Hagley, Stourbridge - was sentenced to six months in prison and a two-year driving disqualification.

Investigating officer, PC Dan Barker, from West Mercia Police said: ""This was a tragic incident to investigate, and our thoughts go out to David's family at this time.

58808,birminghammail--2019-03-21--Birmingham psychologist reveals truth behind Alesha MacPhails killer Aaron Campbell,3/21/2019,birminghammail,Birmingham psychologist reveals truth behind Alesha MacPhail's killer Aaron Campbell,"A Birmingham psychologist has revealed her thoughts on convicted murderer Aaron Campbell.

The 16-year-old was sentenced to at least 27 years in jail by a judge at Glasgow High Court this morning.

During sentencing Lord Matthews said Campbell showed a ""staggering lack of emotion"" and that he did not see ""one flicker of emotion"" from him during the nine-day trial last month, after which a jury found him unanimously guilty.

He described Campbell as a ""cold, callous, calculating, remorseless and dangerous individual"".

Now Professor Elizabeth Yardley, a Professor of Criminology and Director of the Centre for Applied Criminology at Birmingham City University, has told the Mirror that this wasn't a ""random"" incident where Campbell ""snapped"".

She said Alesha's murder was ""one of the most awful cases I've come across"".

""If you look at the extent of violence that was used, she had 117 injuries, this was not the case of a normal, healthy individual one day turned into a homicidal child-killer the next,"" she explains.

""This is somebody who would have had an extensive history of problematic behaviour. This is someone who really values violence and enjoys hurting other people.

""I think one of the most disturbing things to me was how calm he was afterwards.""

CCTV footage from Campbell's mother's own security system provided evidence which helped detectives catch the killer.

His mother had contacted police herself, hoping the footage would eliminate her son from the investigation.

Prof Yardley added: ""You've got this CCTV of him just sauntering home so he doesn't appear to have an emotional reaction to it. He appears to be emotionally empty and he's got this lack of remorse.

""Most of the offenders I work with who've been convicted of manslaughter and murder can't function at all because they're so abhorred by the harm they've caused. They can't behave in a normal way at all, and so for Campbell to react in that way suggests some psychopathic tendencies to me.

""Another key thing that comes through for me is that Alesha was a girl. That's a really significant thing here and that the attack involved sexual violence - that tells us about his views about women and girls, who they are and how they should behave.

""It's inherently misogynistic. One of the most common things we see in cases of femicide is strangulation and that's what we've got here.""

A post-mortem found Alesha died of ""pressure to the face and neck"".

After Campbell was found guilty and Lord Matthews lifted the anonymity order, it emerged that the 16-year-old had a fascination with the Slenderman character and violent video games.

But Prof Yardley doesn't believe the the gruesome character would not have compelled him to carry out the awful attack - instead she argues he would have been drawn to Slenderman because it reinforced his views.

""I always say these things cause people to commit these acts of violence, people are watching this kind of stuff but they support the views and values that they already have,"" she explains.

""It isn't something that triggers this kind of thing.""

She also doesn't agree with calling him ""evil"", rather he's a person who ""decided to do an evil thing"".

""Given how sustained the attack was and the number of injuries that she had - that's 117 decisions to keep inflicting harm on somebody.

""This is someone who knows exactly what they're doing, they know what they're doing is wrong and they just choose to do it anyway.""

Ms Yardley has worked with countless offenders and says this level of violence is usually something they take ""years to work up to"".

""For somebody who is a teenager to be doing this kind of thing is really rare, thankfully, but when it does happen, it's horrendous.""

Neighbours claim this wasn't his first act of violence, although none of the stories have been corroborated, but stories have been making their rounds on the island about him previously nearly drowning a young girl at a leisure centre pool when he was a young child.

He's also said to have slaughtered and skinned cats in his younger teens, apparently burying two feline corpses in his garden.

And one neighbour claimed Campbell had become a local nuisance on Bute and was once caught trying to set fire to buildings.

Prof Yardley said: ""I'd argue that people don't just snap, that's not a thing.

""In order to perpetrate something this horrendously violent, you need to value violence and that comes from a messy combination of nature and nurture. I'd say it's what they observe in the world around them growing up is quite an important factor in leading to this kind of thing.

""All the violent men I work with have some kind of horrendous abuse, or neglect, or trauma in their early lives.

""They feel that during their time as children, they didn't have a lot of control and that develops into an intense need to be in control as adolescents and adults. And for some people that can mean harming other people.

""This is a young man who wants to call all the shots, he wants everything his way.""

A psychological evaluation carried out on July 9 and 10 last year highlighted no issues to suggest he was not of sound mind when he murdered Alesha.

At a hearing after the trial ended it emerged the teenager had a history of self harm, anxiety and depression, and has been tested for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.

The murder trial heard about the teenager's social media activity after Alesha was murdered, including a Snapchat video in which Campbell looked into a mirror and said: “Found the guy who’s done it.""

The court also heard how he had spoken to a friend about killing someone for the ""life experience"".

Prof Yardey argues that he will have loved the attention after the anonymity order was lifted and will embrace his new-found notoriety.

""There's quite a sense of narcissism about him that he's enjoying the attention,"" she said.

""When the anonymity order was lifted I thought, 'he's going to be quite liking this'.

""It's Alesha's name we should be remembering from this case and not his.

""He's going to enjoy people talking about him, having his name and picture out there in the papers and he'll really enjoy the fact that people are trying to figure out what drove him to do this.

""But he's not going to have an easy time in prison at all...child killers are right at the bottom of the pecking order. He's going to have one eye open all of the time.""

The Professor believes he'd have killed again if he'd not been apprehended for Alesha's murder but she does think he can be rehabilitated, if he accepts responsibility for the harm he has caused.

When you look at the level of harm he's inflicted and the fact that he enjoy doing that, I think the only thing that saved potential future victims is that he's a very inexperienced offender.

""He was incredibly disorganised, he wasn't forensically aware enough to try and cover his tracks. This was someone who was capable of more harm and he still is now.

""Everybody is capable of change. I've seen examples of that happen but in order for somebody to change their behaviour, they need to acknowledge that what they've done and accept responsibility for it.

""I've worked with people convicted of murder, manslaughter, armed robbery and during their time in prison they have decided 'I don't want to be this person anymore'. And it can take years and years and years but they have got there in the end.""

""It's so disturbing to think that someone of that age can consciously decide to cause that amount of harm but that's what we've got in this case and we really need to understand where that came from in order to prevent this happening again.

""He certainly wasn't an innocent little boy one minutes and then played a violent video game and turned into a killer.""",Katie Brooks,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/birmingham-psychologist-reveals-truth-behind-16008069,2019-03-21 13:50:23+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Ieuan Harley, 23, murdered David Gaut after discovering he had been jailed for killing a 15-month-old boy in 1985.

Gaut was stabbed to death in August last year in New Tredegar, South Wales.

Harley, who was convicted of murder after a trial in February, was sentenced to life in prison on Monday with a minimum term of 24 years,  WalesOnline  reports.

In February, a jury found Mr Gaut's neighbour David Osborne, 51, not guilty of murder or manslaughter after he was accused of taking part in the killing.

Harley and Darran Evesham, 47, were also found guilty of perverting the course of justice, a charge Osborne had admitted before the trial, after attempting to dispose of evidence of the killing.

During the trial, Newport Crown Court heard Mr Gaut was killed on the night of August 2 last year after his neighbours in Long Row, New Tredegar, discovered he had served 32 years in jail for killing toddler Chi Ming Shek in 1985.

Prosecutors alleged he was lured to neighbour Osborne's flat before being attacked with at least two knives, before being stabbed at least 150 times while he was still alive and another 26 times after his death, and his fingernails were also cut off.

At least one knife was said to have been used to kill Mr Gaut and a screwdriver was later used to stab his dead body, leaving him with injuries that were so gruesome pictures were deliberately kept away from the jury.

The murder weapon had been thrust into Mr Gaut with such force that part of it was found broken off in his sternum.

A Peugeot car was set on fire hours after the killing, which Evesham later told a BBC reporter had contained bloodied sheets from the killing, which he claimed had been committed by ""three spice addicts"".

Police later recovered heavily blood-stained clothing from a riverbank close to where Osborne and Evesham were caught on CCTV walking.

Bloodied towels and sheets were found inside a black Sports Direct bag and nearby was a B&M Bargains bag which contained blood-stained underwear, socks, a white T-shirt and grey Everlast tracksuit bottoms.

Mr Gaut had moved into his block of flats six weeks before his death, telling neighbours he had been released from prison after serving 33 years for killing a soldier.

But neighbour Kyle Alford and his partner Samantha Jenkins discovered he was a convicted child killer after finding his name on the Black Kalendar website, which lists British murders.

The pair told other residents at the block of flats including Osborne and Harley, who was homeless and staying at Osborne's flat.

Mr Alford recalled one conversation he had with Mr Gaut before he died, where he joked about not liking Chinese takeaways, but would order a ""Chi Ming Shek"", the name of the toddler he killed.

Mr Alford said Harley was ""shocked and angry"" when he showed him the website, and Harley said he wanted to ""cut (Gaut) up and put him down the plughole"", before telling Osborne: ""Let's get him in here to set him up.""

Osborne said Mr Gaut came to his flat on the night of his death, but said he was in his kitchen when he heard Mr Gaut screaming for help as Harley attacked him.

Osborne said he entered his lounge to find Harley holding a bloodied knife in his hand and standing over Mr Gaut's body.

Osborne said he asked Harley: ""What the hell have you done in my flat?"", to which Harley replied: ""Don't worry, we'll clean it all up"", before continuing to prod the body.

Osborne said he and Harley moved Mr Gaut's body to his passageway and used bleach to clean up blood, and about 30 minutes later they were joined by Evesham, who arrived ""drunk"" and carried on drinking at the flat.

The three men were said to have carried Mr Gaut's body back to his flat with socks on their hands and also attempted to clean up Osborne's home, dispose of bloodied clothing and set fire to a car to destroy incriminating evidence.

Harley denied murder and said he had been asleep in another room when Mr Gaut was killed, while Evesham, who was cleared of murder earlier in the trial, denied helping to get rid of evidence and moving Mr Gaut's body.

The jury at Newport Crown Court took over five hours to return their verdicts following a three-week trial.

60448,birminghammail--2019-04-10--Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd touches down in London after extradition following months on the run,4/10/2019,birminghammail,Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd touches down in London after extradition following months on the run,"Speedboat killer Jack Shepherd has touched down in London after 10 months on the run.

The 31-year-old told reporters on a Georgian Airways flight as he was extradited from Tbilisi that he acted on ""emotion and fear"" when he fled the UK and now wants to ""make amends"".

He arrived at London Gatwick on Wednesday evening and will appear at the Old Bailey in the morning, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said.

Angela Deal, head of extradition at the CPS said: ""Jack Shepherd has returned to the UK to face justice following close co-operation between the CPS extradition unit, UK colleagues and the Georgian authorities, to ensure a successful extradition.

""He will first appear at the Old Bailey to be sentenced for the gross negligence manslaughter conviction in connection with the death of Charlotte Brown, and then at a later date in the South West over the grievous bodily harm charge.""

Pictures released by the Special Penitentiary Service of Georgia earlier on Wednesday showed a handcuffed Shepherd being led by two uniformed officers into a secure cell in the back of a van.

He was believed to have been transferred to Metropolitan Police officers at Tbilisi International Airport and boarded a plane to Gatwick.

He was sentenced in his absence last year to six years in prison over the death of 24-year-old Charlotte Brown.

She died after the pair went for a late-night speedboat ride down the River Thames in December 2015.

Shepherd told reporters on the plane that he and his family have received threats as a result of ""misplaced"" animosity caused by the media's misreporting of certain aspects of the case.

Wearing an open-collared shirt, Shepherd said: ""There really have been some complete untruths, in particular this idea that I let her drown, that I did nothing to help her, this could not be further from the truth.""

Asked why he did not stay to defend himself in court, he said: ""I wasn't thinking at the time, I was acting on emotion and fear and I made a mistake.

""But now I'm trying to make amends.""

Shepherd added that he regretted not speaking to Ms Brown's family sooner, calling it his ""second biggest mistake"" after taking out the boat that night.

A jury found Shepherd guilty of manslaughter by gross negligence in his absence after he skipped bail last summer.

The web designer's trial heard that he had been drinking champagne on a first date with Ms Brown when they went on the speedboat ride.

His 14ft Fletcher Arrowflyte boat had a series of defects and was speeding when it overturned near Wandsworth Bridge, throwing Ms Brown to her death in the water.

Shepherd, originally from Exeter, was plucked from the cold river.

He made his last appearance before the Old Bailey in November 2017 to deny manslaughter.

It was at the start of his trial last June that it emerged he would not attend court but he remained in regular contact with his defence team who pushed on without him.

The jury found him guilty and Judge Richard Marks QC sentenced him in absentia.

Shepherd told reporters he now felt ""ready to face"" prison and had ""come to terms"" with spending time behind bars.

He added that he felt responsible for Ms Brown's death ""in part"" but ""not to the degree of manslaughter"".

Shepherd will be returned before the judge from 9.30am on Thursday for the execution of a bench warrant. Then his prison sentence awaits.

He could also face extra jail time for absconding but it is not yet known when a judge may add to his sentence.

Shepherd was granted permission to appeal against the conviction in December and surrendered to authorities in Tbilisi the following month.

The family of Ms Brown, from Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, had publicly campaigned for Shepherd to hand himself in.

Her father Graham Brown told ITV after Shepherd agreed to extradition last month that he had a weak case and ""no choice"" but to return.

Shepherd also faces a grievous bodily harm charge over an alleged assault in Devon on March 16 last year.",James Rodger,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/speedboat-killer-jack-shepherd-touches-16111577,2019-04-10 21:01:34+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 31-year-old web developer admitted breaching bail and absconding as he was brought before the Old Bailey for the first time since he ran away to avoid his trial for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown.

He touched down at Gatwick airport on Wednesday night after he handed himself in at Tblisi.

Shepherd, 31, appeared in the dock wearing a dark suit, light shirt and no tie, flanked by two guards.

He last appeared at the Old Bailey in November 2017, when he denied manslaughter.

Ms Brown's parents and both sisters sat to the side of the court with a clear view of Shepherd.

Last year, Shepherd was found guilty in his absence of Ms Brown's manslaughter in a speedboat accident on the Thames and sentenced to six years in jail.

Afterwards, the 24-year-old victim's devastated parents Graham Brown and Roz Wickens expressed their anger at his failure to face the consequences, having attended every day of his trial.

After 10 months on the run, Shepherd, originally from Exeter, was brought before trial judge Richard Marks QC for the execution of a bench warrant for breaching bail.

His Old Bailey trial last June was told that Shepherd was responsible for his speedboat, which had a series of serious defects, including to its steering.

Jurors heard how he and Ms Brown had been drinking champagne and went on a late night high speed jaunt in his boat past the Houses of Parliament on their first date in December 2015.

Shepherd had handed the controls to Ms Brown just before it capsized, tipping both of them into the cold water, the court was told.

The defendant was plucked from the Thames alive, but his date was killed.

As he returned to Britain on Wednesday night, Shepherd said he had acted on ""emotion and fear"" when he fled the UK and now wants to ""make amends"".

Home Secretary Sajid Javid thanked the Georgian authorities for their assistance on Twitter, adding: ""Charlotte Brown's family have endured immeasurable pain & are now one step closer to getting the justice they deserve.""",James Rodger,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/speedboat-killer-jack-shepherd-pleads-16112439,2019-04-11 09:01:20+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
60709,birminghammail--2019-04-16--Killer Birmingham driver Connor McCaugherty jailed for further 20 months after BITING prison officer,4/16/2019,birminghammail,Killer Birmingham driver Connor McCaugherty jailed for further 20 months after BITING prison officer,"Killer Birmingham driver Connor McCaugherty has been jailed for a further 20 months after TWICE biting a prison officer.

The inmate has been barred from meeting inmates after he spat at another officer at a Midlands prison.

The 28-year-old is currently serving his term at Lowdham Grange in Nottingham.

McCaugherty was jailed for 10 years for causing death by dangerous driving in Birmingham in 2011.

Career criminal McCaugherty ploughed into father-of-three Dil Bahadur Subedi after leading cops on a six-mile chase through some of Birmingham’s busiest roads.

McCaugherty had also switched off the lights on the Ford Mondeo and jumped a red light.

He fled the crash scene and torched the car in Rubery in a bid to cover his tracks.

Birmingham Crown Court later heard he was clocked at 110mph on the Aston Expressway and was doing 90mph when he hit Mr Subedi, who had just finished work and was his family’s main breadwinner .

The new sentence will be served at the end of the term imposed for the driving death.

NottinghamshireLive reports Luc Chignell, prosecuting, said the first prison assault took place on May 19 last year when he was told to go into his cell.

Officers tried to restrain him when one felt a sharp pain to the ribs. He discovered he had been bitten.

""He was trying to regain control by grabbing this man and was then bitten on the right hand. It was a nasty bite,"" said Mr Chignell.

He was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre for treatment to the two bites.

The officer needed injections and antibiotics because of concerns he may have caught hepatitis B through the wounds.

The second incident took place in the same prison on July 6.

Mr Chignell told the court: ""The defendant was being kept away from the general population under prison rule 45.

""The officer went to his cell to advise him that he would not be allowed out.

""The defendant tried to defy him and tried to leave.""

The officer ended up in a headlock and had to be released by colleagues.

McCaughtery then spat at him.

The officer needed two days off duty because of concussion and said he was nervous about returning to the prison.

McCaughtery had denied assaulting the first officer causing actual bodily harm but was found guilty by magistrates. He admitted the second charge of common assault.

Will Bennett, mitigating, told the court McCaughtery suffers from symptoms similar to post-traumatic stress disorder.

""This is as a result of the fact that he caused the death of a pedestrian in a police chase.

""The PTSD arises from that incident.""

McCaughtery was driving a green Ford Mondeo when he struck the victim.

The car was later burnt out with a witness claiming the driver walked away laughing.

Homeless McCaugherty admitted causing death by dangerous driving and trying to pervert justice by setting light to the car.

When sentenced for the road death at Birmingham Crown Court, Judge Mark Wall QC told him: ""You killed Mr Subedi whilst you were on bail and subject to a suspended sentence.

""You drove at more than 100mph, on the wrong side of the carriageway, across pedestrian crossings and for a protracted period with your lights off.

""In terror, Mr Subedi jumped one way and his friend jumped the other. You showed a total disregard for the safety of others who were in great danger because of your actions.""","Rod Malcolm, James Rodger",https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/killer-birmingham-driver-connor-mccaugherty-16134581,2019-04-16 08:21:16+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
61049,birminghammail--2019-04-20--Ruthless killer jailed over shocking drug dealer murder is Birmingham YouTube rap star Lemz,4/20/2019,birminghammail,Ruthless killer jailed over shocking drug dealer murder is Birmingham YouTube rap star Lemz,"A ruthless killer who knifed and beat to death a drug dealer in a shocking murder is a Birmingham YouTube rap star.

CCTV footage captured the moment five hooded gangsters entered Przemsyslaw Golimowski's flat before murdering him in a brutal revenge killing.

One of the men convicted of his murder is 31-year-old Sparkhill drug dealer Taleb Hussain.

The 31-year-old, from Park Road, has been unmasked as a YouTube rap star who goes by the name of Lemz.

His video to his song On My Own has been more than 733,000 views on You Tube.

In the video which is filmed in Birmingham the blinged-up rapper is seen buying clothes from Selfridges and seen posing next to a £60,000 gold coloured BMW M4.

He is then seen walking out of a prison door as the video pans to the sign saying Welcome to HMP Birmingham.

The lyrics to his rap include: ""Most my friends still behind the door so I gotta go with the flow, never let them down 'cus I felt it, now the writings on the wall like a felt tip, I've got to be the next one to blow,  if I don't, f*** it, I'mma still invest into dope.""

it has also been revealed that Hussain was jailed back in 2012 as part of Operation Stalham, a long running operation in Bedford aimed at street dealers which saw nineteen people charged with drugs supply and firearms offences, resulting in total prison sentences of 54 years.

Hussain, whio was 24 at the time, had been running a drug dealing gang from Bedford. When arrested, he threw a loaded handgun from the front window of his house in Adelaide Square, along with another parcel containing heroin and cocaine worth £20,000. Police discovered £6000 cash in the house.

The CCTV footage taken just before Golimowski's murder shows Hussain pacing towards the Bedford home in the dead of night.

Hussain was later arrested in Birmingham after his bloodied palm print was found staining the stair banister in the victim's block.

Przemsyslaw, 30, was asleep in bed with his partner when the five intruders broke into his flat last September.

Hussain, 31, along with Damien Rooney, 25, Delpierro Mothersill, 20, Philip Mendy, 23, and Jamal Jeng, 21, then began attacking him with a knife and golf club.

Their victim fled to a neighbour's flat in a desperate bid to escape, but collapsed from his injuries.

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

The killing followed a dispute between rivalling drug dealers who were all linked to the supply of drugs.

A day before the murder, Mothersill - a known drug runner for Hussain and Rooney - was attacked and robbed by Golimowski and another man.

He was injured with a pool cue during the assault at another address in Bedford.

Later, police suggested that Golimowski was a drug dealer himself and had been behind a number of robberies from rival dealers.

Officers were able to track down Golimowski's five killers from the blood trail left by Jeng - who was stabbed in his leg during the killing.

CCTV and analysis of mobile phone activity placed Jeng and the other four together in the run up to the attack.

Earlier in the day, CCTV from Bicester Shopping Village clearly showed Hussain, Jeng and Mendy together at the site before heading back to Bedford.

Hussain, Rooney, Jeng, Mendy and Mothersill were captured together by CCTV at Wodka Live in St Paul’s Square less than two hours before the attack.

Automatic number plate recognition also captured a vehicle linked to Hussain driving around the town on multiple occasions.

As they entered Golimowski’s address through Duck Mill Lane, CCTV above captured five men matching the descriptions and clothing of the five men when they were caught on CCTV at Wodka Live.

The same camera also caught Hussain, Rooney, Mendy and Mothersill as they fled from the scene.

Hussain’s palm print was also found on the bannister leading up to the entrance to Golimowski’s flat.

Hussain, Rooney, of Wixams and Mothersill of Bedford, were convicted of murder at Luton Crown Court on Monday (April 15).

Each were jailed for life - and ordered to serve a minimum of 26 years.

Mendy, from Bedford, and Jeng, from Clapham, were convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to 12 years each in prison.

Lenz isn't the first Birmingham rapper to be jailed.

Last November Maher Ali, a YouTube rapper known as Young Smokes, an artist who bragged about drugs, cash, guns and girls was jailed.

He received a two-year sentence after cops stopped the 21-year-old in a dead-end street in Digbeth, only to find a stolen Beretta shotgun in the back of his VW Golf.

Officers also later found three machetes hidden under Ali's bed in Vaughton Street, Highgate.

in March last year fellow grime star Cameron Wright - known as Killa Kam was locked up after leading an evil drugs ring which saw Class A drugs supplied on a huge scale.

The 28-year-old, from Sparkhill, provided over 100 customers with heroin and cocaine as he acted as king pin for the large-scale drugs operation in Cheltenham.

Known as Killa Kam on Birmingham's rap scene, Wright can be seen flicking through wads of cash while singing about ""getting paid"" and ""shifting gear on the space streets"" in one of his music videos.

61458,birminghammail--2019-04-30--Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale wants to serve out sentence in Nigeria jail despite being born i,4/30/2019,birminghammail,Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale 'wants to serve out sentence in Nigeria jail despite being born in UK',"Lee Rigby killer Michael Adebowale ""wants to serve out sentence in a Nigeria jail"", it has been claimed.

The brazen desire from the savage terrorist comes despite him being born in the UK.

Radical Michael Adebolajo and accomplice Adebowale spotted Lee wearing a Help for Heroes hoodie and mowed him down in their car.

They then jumped out and attacked him with knives and a meat cleaver, near the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich on May 22, 2013.

37-year-old Adebowale is currently in HMP Wakefield.

He has even written to immigration experts asking for their advice.

""It's stuffed full of lags who see him as a top target.

""He thinks he can spend the rest of his sentence in Africa.""

Mr Rigby's mother Lynn reacted to the news, branding it an insult to her son.

She fumed: ""This is a disgrace and an insult to Lee.

""I'm sure he doesn't like Wakefield Prison but he has the luxury of being alive unlike my son who he stole from me.

""He should serve his sentence here and not try to exploit the law for a cushier life.""

Last year it was reported Lee's evil killer Adebolajo  has finally admitted he is ""sorry"" and told of his regret at taking the innocent soldier's life.

Adebolajo has admitted his remorse in a dramatic u-turn after five years in jail - and plans on penning a letter of apology to Lee's family.

The former Christian claims he ""misinterpreted"" the holy Quran and no longer wants to be known by his Islamic name, Mujahid Abu Hamza.

Adebolajo tried to behead the ­fusilier with a knife and spouted Islamic hatred as his innocent victim lay dying in the street.

With his hands covered in blood, he told witnesses to call the police, adding: ""The only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers.

""And this British soldier is one. It is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

""Through many passages in the Koran, we must fight them as they fight us.""

But after a stint at Belmarsh, Frankland and Wakefield jails, where staff moved him around to prevent him from influencing others, Adebolajo claims he ""feels guilty.""

A source told the Sun on Sunday that it was the first time he had ever wavered from his beliefs, making his confession ""remarkable.""

They added: ""A month ago he approached a fellow inmate and member of prison pastoral staff to say he finally regretted the murder.

“He told them he acknowledged for the first time he had taken an innocent life.

“He even admitted he misinterpreted the Koran in trying to justify his horrific actions. It’s an astonishing rejection of his extremist beliefs.”

He also told prisoners he now rejects his extremist views, admitting he was ""brainwashed"" and the attack was ""misguided.""",James Rodger,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/lee-rigby-killer-michael-adebowale-16200710,2019-04-30 08:52:07+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hashim Abdalla Ali, 22, was hit in the chest while sitting in the passenger seat of a car outside his father's flat in Hayes, west London.

The driver attempted to take the victim to hospital, but crashed en route while trying to overtake traffic, the Old Bailey heard.

A doctor flew in by air ambulance and performed open heart surgery at the scene, but the victim was pronounced dead shortly after.

Juskiran Sidhu, 28, and Babatunde Philip Fashakin, 26, walked away from the scene on Central Avenue, before buying new outfits at JD Sports and watching true crime film King Of Thieves at a cinema, it was claimed.

An Old Bailey jury found both men guilty of murder and they were remanded into custody to be sentenced next Tuesday.

Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told jurors the motive for the ""cold blooded"" killing was not known, or whether the real target was the victim or the driver of the car.

He told how, on the afternoon of October 11 last year, shocked witnesses heard a loud bang as the victim was shot before the killers walked away.

Afterwards, Sidhu and Fashakin travelled to a JD Sports in Staines in Surrey where they bought new outfits, dumped their old clothes in a bin then headed to the cinema.

Babatunde Fashakin lunged at Juskiran Sidhu and shouted: ""You are a coward"" in astonishing scenes at the Old Bailey .

Fashakin repeatedly punched his fellow killer in the face before he was restrained by security guards.

A member of the public could be heard saying: ""That's justice bro.""

It happened after both were jailed for life and told they would serve at least 30 years.

The killers were both convicted of murdering 22-year-old Hashim Ali over a drugs feud following a trial, MyLondon reported .

He was shot dead as he sat in a friend's Mercedes C300 in Hayes, West London.

Fashakin, 26, went for Sidhu, 26, after they were sentenced.

Judge Nigel Lickley QC concluded that Hashim was shot as part of an ""ongoing feud"" which was ""undoubtedly based on drug dealing"" .

He said the crime was made more serious as he was shot in public, ""in broad daylight"" and close to the busy Uxbridge Road.

The judge said the pair would have decided to carry out the ""assassination"" very quickly after seeing the car containing Hashim, estimating it was ""less than 50 seconds"".

He told them: ""You walked with purpose, with your hoods up. He was unable to defend himself, trapped by his position in the car. You ambushed him and shot him in a ruthless and brutal act of violence.""

The judge concluded Sidhu was the gunman after video footage showed him ""overtake Fashakin"" so he was the first to reach the car.

Sidhu was also the first to dispose of his clothes after the murder, which Judge Lickley said ""could only have been because [he] believed the clothes were contaminated"" by evidence of gunfire.

Fashakin removed his clothes later and the pair bought matching tracksuits and went to the cinema to hide. The judge described how Sidhu re-enacted his crime in front of friends, in the proximity of members of the public, and that Fashakin was unmoved.

Judge Lickley said: ""You showed no emotion or sign of anxiety. When Sidhu demonstrated the shooting to a friend, you did not react because you knew precisely what had happened.""

The judge therefore concluded that, though he did not fire the gun,

Fashakin was ""party to the agreement to shoot and kill"" as the pair ""worked as a team"".

He also determined, from the fact that neither man has ""any means of supporting their life"", that they were ""part of an organised drug operation"" 

and that this was a ""dispute between criminal organisations which spilled on to the streets of London"".

Both men were on the run until they were arrested in Birmingham. Sidhu was arrested on October 13 at a hotel, whereas Fashakin was arrested at student accommodation on November 6.

He read out a long list of previous convictions for both men, who had both been offending since their teenage years.

Sidhu had previously been convicted of offences including dangerous driving, possession of heroin with intent to supply and conspiracy to produce a class B drug.

62340,birminghammail--2019-05-28--Convicted killer threatened to rape woman before murdering nail technician mum-of-two,5/28/2019,birminghammail,Convicted killer 'threatened to rape woman before murdering nail technician mum-of-two',"A convicted killer threatened to attack and rape a woman about a month before he murdered a ""beautiful"" Vietnamese mother-of-two, an inquest has heard.

Nail technician Quyen Ngoc Nguyen was murdered by Stephen Unwin and William McFall on August 15 2017 before being dumped in her own car and set alight on Shiney Row, near Sunderland.

The pair, who were convicted of the 28-year-old's murder and sentenced to full-life terms in April last year, had previously committed separate murders and met while in prison for those offences.

They met Ms Ngoc Nguyen while working as handymen on several flats she was renting out, their trial at Newcastle Crown Court heard.

An inquest into her death started on Tuesday at Sunderland Coroners' Court after coroner Derek Winter decided it was necessary to look into whether the police and probation service missed opportunities to prevent the murder.

For the latest on trials and court cases from across Birmingham and the West Midlands, join BirminghamLive's Court Facebook group .

The court heard that Unwin, of Houghton-le-Spring, Sunderland, was released from jail on licence on December 20 2012, with Northumbria Police receiving 26 ""items of intelligence"" between his release date and the murder of Ms Ngoc Nguyen.

Detective Inspector Edward Small told the court one of those items related to a complaint from a woman that, on July 2 2017, Unwin had sent her a Facebook audio message threatening to ""smash her jaw in"" and take turns with another man to rape her.

The court heard that the complainant in that incident had mentioned to officers over the phone that Unwin had served prison time for murder.

The officer who looked into the complainant's report the following day, Pc Sarah Strong, told the inquest she ""can't remember"" whether she was aware the alleged offender was a convicted murderer at the time.

Pc Strong said it was probable that she would have only briefly read the force's report on Unwin before speaking with the complainant on July 3 2017, due to the time pressure caused by having to investigate numerous cases on a day-to-day basis.

She told the inquest the alleged victim had not taken the complaint any further, and the investigation effectively ended then.

Asked whether an alleged threat from a convicted murderer should have prompted more action, Pc Strong said: ""Unfortunately these types of threats are not uncommon and are the kind of things that people do say on Facebook.""

Mr Small said a change in how the force logged ""flags"", meaning relevant intelligence, regarding prisoners out on licence would have meant that incidents like Unwin's alleged threat were not automatically passed to probation services.

From 2013 the force operated a system where flags on an on-licence offender's record would be passed to probation officers through the force's Multi-Agency Public Protection Arrangements (Mappa).

But he said that, in a bid to reduce workload, from April 24 2015 warnings about an offender's behaviour would have to be reported to probation officers through a police officer at their own discretion.

Mr Small said that, in December last year, Northumbria Police introduced a system whereby flags against an offender would be passed to a ""multi-agency safeguarding hub"", as well as to probation services through the investigating officer.

Detective Chief Inspector Lisa Laverick told the inquest that, despite the change in 2015, a message on Unwin's report incorrectly said that flags would be passed on to probation through Mappa.

Discussing the scope of the inquest, which is expected to last nine days, the coroner said he will consider whether the killers' levels of risk were properly assessed.

He said witnesses will also be questioned on whether information relevant to a ""potential recall"" of the men before Ms Ngoc Nguyen's death was brought to the attention of the relevant parties.",James Rodger,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/convicted-killer-threatened-rape-woman-16345129,2019-05-28 20:13:16+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Detectives investigating the murder of Keelan Wilson have launched a fresh plea for information a year on from his death.

The 15-year-old was discovered with fatal stab wounds following reports of disorder in Langley Road, Merry Hill, at around 11pm on May 29, last year.

West Midlands Police issued a statement on the anniversary of the murder to say detectives continue to work on the case in the pursuit of Keelan's killer or killers. 

  

So far, nine teenagers have been arrested in connection with his murder and released under investigation as enquiries continue. 





Officers are now re-appealing, on the 12-month anniversary of his sad death, for anyone with information to come forward. 

  

Detective Chief Inspector Chris Mallett, from the force's homicide team, said: ""It is exactly a year on from Keelan's tragic death and we are just as determined now, as we were then, to get justice for his family. 

  

""This is a complex investigation and there is ongoing work which is not always visible to the public. 

  

""However, we continue to need your help in catching Keelan's killer or killers. I appreciate there may have been people who didn't feel they could speak to officers at the time due to a sense of misguided loyalty.



""But this a 15-year-old boy, who had his life ahead of him, who has been taken away at the hands of a knife and we need to ensure justice prevails. Any piece of information, however insignificant you feel it is, could be crucial in cracking the case.""

62806,birminghammail--2019-06-02--EXCLUSIVE - Drugs kingpin John Anslow batters Lee Rigby killer in jail feud,6/2/2019,birminghammail,EXCLUSIVE - Drugs kingpin John Anslow batters Lee Rigby killer in jail feud,"BLACK Country drugs baron John Anslow – the mobster whose jail escape made national headlines – has been involved in a violent prison clash with the killers of soldier Lee Rigby.

And the underworld kingpin, sentenced to 22 years for orchestrating a coke and cannabis distribution network, got the better of the brawl, his father, John Snr, claimed.

The fight was the culmination of simmering bad blood between Tipton’s Anslow, who spent 439 days on the run before being snared in Northern Cyprus, and Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale.

Anslow, whose cell in high-security nick Belmarsh neighboured the terrorists’ lock-ups, had become increasingly agitated over the pair’s loud, all night conversations.

His dad said: “All night and all day they were shouting. One each side of him. One tried to put it on him and came off worst. John got him on the floor and was throwing punches before the screws pulled him off. He gave it to him. He stood his ground and had a go back.”

He added: “They (Adebolajo and Adebowale) are the worst of the worst. I’d like to do to them what they did to Lee Rigby.”

A spokesperson from the Ministry of Justice questioned the claim, although, without a date for the incident, admitted a probe into the allegation was near impossible.

She stressed strict conditions were in place to prevent Adebolajo and Adebowale mingling with other Belmarsh inmates. Such a confrontation would be ‘unlikely’, she claimed.

The extremists’ savage crime revolted the nation. On May 22, 2013, they mowed down 25-year-old Lee near Woolwich’s Royal Artillery Barracks, in London, then hacked him to death with knives and a cleaver in the road. They yelled to passers-by that Lee had been targeted in retaliation over the killing of Muslims by British soldiers.

In February 2014 both men were sentenced to life: Adebolajo, aged 28, is one of the few UK prisoners serving a whole life term. He is destined to die behind bars.

Before being snared, father-of-three Anslow posted message of support for our troops. But John Snr questions why the 38-year-old was placed in close prison proximity to the extremists – and in earshot of their radical views. Following the incident, which occurred a couple of years ago, Anslow was transferred to Frankland Prison, County Durham, and is currently incarcerated at HM Prison, Wakefield, the largest high security prison in Britain.

He and his father are glad to see the back of Belmarsh’s ultra-strict regime. The Thamesmead, London, institute is used for the detention of terrorists.

“It was a joke,” said John Snr, who now lives in London, “there was no sympathy (towards visitors).” He previously dubbed the prison barbaric.

“He is OK and half way through (his sentence). He can get out more and mix with the general prison population.”

In 2012 Anslow was convicted, while still in hiding, of conspiracy to supply Class A drugs, appealed over his long sentence three years later – and failed.

He gained a global reputation as a gangster after being sprung from a prison van taking him to crown court.

Known on the streets as Skitz, the hardman was liberated from outside Redditch’s Hewell Prison in January, 2012, by a masked gang armed with sledgehammers. They drove off in a silver Merc.

Anslow was the first Category A prisoner to escape since 1995 and the break-out earned him an additional seven years.

He was no shrinking violet while evading the long arm of the law, taunting police on social media sites. Threads on one Twitter account - OutOntheRun – included: “Lapping it up in the sun! I hear they don’t even talk about me on the news back home anymore.”

On Facebook he posted a defiant message: “Go on, jog on, walk on, goodbye, bon voyage, f*** off - and **** everybody that got a problem with me.”

Another site titled ‘John Anslow Is An Innocent Man Being Set Up’ has clocked up more than 300 ‘likes’.

The villain’s whereabouts gripped the nation, with reports of sightings in Spain, Morocco and the UK - including Birmingham city centre.

Chillingly, at the height of the manhunt, our newsdesk received a gloating, anonymous call pin-pointing the fugitive’s location.

“You’re not even close,” the underworld figure told this reporter. “John’s in Northern Cyprus.”

“You think you know everything,” he laughed.

Police asked the Sunday Mercury not to report the information in the name of “responsible reporting”. We agreed.

Anslow was collared in March 2013 in the desolate Alsancak district of Northern Cyprus – a country which has become the criminal fraternity’s new bolthole because it shares no extradition treaty with the UK.

But he was arrested on suspicion of immigration offences and deported by the Turkish Cypriot authorities.

Like his prison breakout, Anslow’s escape from the UK – despite airports and ports being placed on high alert – was the stuff of big screen gangster blockbusters.

Sources informed this paper he was smuggled out of the country in a metal freight box.

He spent three days in the box, briefly seeing daylight when the tanker docked in Italy. He only emerged when the cargo was finally unloaded in Turkey.

From there, Anslow – subject of an international hunt and with a £10,000 reward on his head – travelled to the gangster paradise of Northern Cyprus.

John Snr has always maintained his son’s luxury lifestyle – the Wolverhampton Wanderers fanatic spent £36,000 on sponsorship at Molineux – was built on elaborate gambling scams, not narcotics.

Back in 2014, he said: “Yes, he’s dabbled in drugs, but not to the extent that’s been said. My son’s no angel – far from it – but he’s not what they’ve made him out to be.

Claims that Anslow was a mere minnow in the illicit drugs trade were not borne out by information and evidence gathered by the police.

A bug in his Bradley flat revealed a far-reaching drugs network. A subsequent raid uncovered a Rolex watch and tell-tale signs of a luxury lifestyle funded by thousands of pounds of cocaine and cannabis.

From Anslow’s Tipton manor, large quantities of drugs were distributed nationally.",newsdesk@birminghamlive.co.uk (Mike Lockley),https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/exclusive-drugs-kingpin-john-anslow-16367124,2019-06-02 10:29:51+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anslow, whose cell neighboured the terrorists’ lock-ups, had become increasingly agitated over the pair’s loud, all night conversations and ultimately got the better of the brawl, his father, John Snr, claimed.

Anslow became infamous after being the first category A prisoner to escape custody in more than 17 years.

The underworld kingpin was sprung from a prison van in a ""well-orchestrated armed ambush"" in January 2012 whilst he was being taken from Hewell Prison in Redditch to Stafford Crown Court.

The Black Country criminal, then 35, went on the run after a gang of three masked men stopped the prison van, smashed its windows with sledgehammers and punched its driver.

Anslow had led a lavish lifestyle as head of a major drugs ring selling cocaine and cannabis across the West Midlands, and he was due to be transferred to a high security jail.

His dad said: “All night and all day they were shouting.

""One each side of him.

""One tried to put it on him and came off worst.

""John got him on the floor and was throwing punches before the screws pulled him off.

BirminghamLive readers have flocked to have their say on social media.

""Great news, this man deserves an award"" wrote Rose Richardson, while Paresh added: ""Good news 100% proud of him!""

""Well done lad! We are all super proud of you,"" added Alison.

John Nooman added: ""As a former soldier, thank you.""

""Should have his sentence reduced,"" Steve Morgan said.

But not everybody agreed, with one BirminghamLive reader condemning those lauding his actions.

""An eye for an eye makes us all blind,"" they wrote.

A second concurred, writing: ""I can't believe people are condoning violence.""

Details of the drugs empire that Anslow led were revealed by police after he was cleared of a murder charge.

West Midlands Police said he used drugs cash to fund a lavish lifestyle of fast cars and luxury holidays.

Between July 2010 and March 2011 he splashed out £24,000 on holidays to the Dominican Republic, St Lucia and Bangkok, which were paid for in cash.

He also owned several high-value cars and showered his partner with Rolex watches and diamond jewellery that were collectively valued at £26,440.

The avid Wolverhampton Wanderers fan also spent more than £36,000 in sponsorship at the Molineux Stadium between 2008 and 2011.

Police also found £107,900 in cash hidden inside two safes at his home.

On 11 February 2011, two days after the Liverpool drugs find, West Midlands Police officers uncovered half a kilo of 100 per cent pure cocaine along with cutting agents and a drugs press at a Tipton business premises belonging to one of Anslow’s associates.

He was caught when police in Liverpool tracked a local drug dealer to an address in February 2011 and uncovered cannabis with a street value of more than £1.1 million.

The drugs courier linked back to Anslow’s Tipton home and phone analysis revealed regular contact between Anslow and the men monitored by Merseyside Police.

Realising he was wanted for questioning, Anslow sent West Midlands Police a Spanish postcard in an attempt to convince detectives he’d fled to the continent.

But police didn’t fall for the trick and found him lying low on August 12, 2011 in a Bewdley caravan park.",newsdesk@birminghamlive.co.uk (James Rodger),https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/lee-rigbys-killers-battered-prison-16369521,2019-06-03 07:51:45+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Wayne Kendall climbed from his own flat in Bloxwich Road South, Willenhall into the home of victim Kevin Shepperson who lived directly above.

The 22-year-old sneaked into Mr Shepperson’s flat via a window before letting cousin Nazeem Kendall, aged 22, and Camerron Mackenzie, 21, into the property. The video can be viewed above.

Once inside, the trio battered Mr Shepperson with a dumbbell weight.

Mr Shepperson was later discovered the following day by a friend.

The 39-year-old was found with his hands and feet tied and a belt strap around his neck; his TV and PlayStation had also been taken.

A post mortem examination revealed he was repeatedly stamped on, suffered rib fractures and brain injuries.

West Midlands Police discovered the tragic victim's bank card had been taken and used to pay for a hotel stay hours after he was killed.

In December 2018, Camerron Mackenzie, of Richmond Street, Walsall, pleaded guilty to murder and today (June 17), following a three-week trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court, Wayne of Bloxwich Road South, Walsall and Nazeem, of no fixed abode, have been found guilty of murder and robbery.

The three men will be sentenced at a later date.

The three men will be sentenced at a later date.

Mackenzie, following the killing on August 21 last year , used his own details for a hotel reservation.

Both Mackenzie and Wayne Kendall were arrested just two days after Mr Shepperson’s body was discovered. Nazeem Kendall was detained two weeks later.

Detectives found the victim’s blood on a dumbbell in Wayne Kendall’s flat – along with the stolen electrical items – and DNA recovered from skin scrapings found under the victim’s fingernails failed to rule out Nazeem as a potential suspect.

In an emotional tribute, Mr Shepperson’s family said: ""On 22 August 2018 our lives were torn apart when we were informed that our son Kevin had died.

""To find out this information was bad enough but to have someone deliberately and viciously beat and stamp on him until his injuries caused his death is unbearable.

""Kevin has had his struggle over the years with addiction but the only person he hurt was himself. At the time of Kevin’s death he had turned his life around.

""We are pleased that the people responsible for Kevin’s death, whose only aim was to profit from stealing his property for their own enjoyment, have been found guilty of his killing.

""The past ten months have been a nightmare and have been an emotional and painful time. No parent should ever have to bury their child.

""We would very much like to thank the Police, specifically the Homicide Department who completed a thorough investigation into what happened to our son and we cannot thank them enough.

""They stood up for Kevin when he was unable to have a voice.

""The amount of work and hours spent on the investigation has been extensive and we really appreciate everyone’s efforts.

""We have been supported throughout our ordeal by our family liaison officers who have been our rock.

""We would like to thank Mr Kent and Ms Wolf, our legal team, for presenting the evidence provided by the police and successfully getting the right outcome for Kevin.

""No sentence given will ever be enough for our son’s life but it is a comfort that the people responsible are now behind bars and unable to hurt other innocent people.

""We miss Kevin terribly and I can’t imagine that this will ever go away.""

Detective Sergeant Tim Longbottom, from force CID said: ""This was a brutal attack on a man in his own home.

""Mr Shepperson was very security conscious and yet they managed to climb up via the window to pursue their attack.

""The cowardly group not only killed him, they stole his belongings and continued to spend the dead man’s money.

Boy A has also been found guilty of aggravated sexual assault.

Ana Kriegel's naked body was found with a ligature around the neck in a derelict house in Lucan, Co Dublin, days after the 14 year-old went missing on May 14, 2018.

Desmond Sylva, 41, knifed his on-off girlfriend Simonne Kerr, 31, more than 70 times at his flat in Clapham, south London, on August 15 last year.

The former soldier, who served in Iraq and Kosovo, admitted manslaughter but denied murder, citing depression.

But prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC told jurors it was an all too familiar case of ""sexual desire, appalling violence and desperate lies"".

He said: ""He wanted to restart a sexual relationship with Simonne Kerr. When he did not get what he wanted, he could not control his anger and he exploded.""

Sylva made no reaction as the Old Bailey jury delivered its guilty verdict after three days of deliberations.

Ms Kerr, whose six-year-old son Kavele tragically died of sickle cell disease, shot to fame in the NHS choir B Positive on the ITV show Britain's Got Talent.

She met Sylva through dating app Tinder and arranged to visit his flat after finishing her shift at Guys and St Thomas's Hospital on the morning of August 15.

Sylva attacked her in bed with a 20cm kitchen knife, slashing her throat and repeatedly stabbing her face and neck.

Afterwards, he called 999 and said: ""I've just committed a murder. I'm ex-Army and I've got lots of mental health issues.""

Mr Glasgow told jurors: ""It is hard to imagine how terrifying the last few minutes of Simonne Kerr's life must have been as she struggled to prevent the man who was supposed to care for her from murdering her.

""The moment she realised the man who had been pursuing her wanted more than a relationship and in fact wanted to kill her must have been utterly horrifying.""

For the latest on trials and court cases from across Birmingham and the West Midlands, join BirminghamLive's Court Facebook group .

Sylva had a history or depression, bipolar disorder and post traumatic stress disorder - but also had problems controlling his temper, jurors heard.

Before he joined the Army, Jamaican-born Sylva had cut his neck while working in a bakery.

The divorced father-of-one served 10 years in the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers before being discharged on medical grounds.

In 2010, Sylva throttled his mother Patricia King, telling her repeatedly: ""You're dead,"" jurors heard.

Ms King reported the assault to police, but later withdrew the complaint because he had been depressed and suicidal.

Sylva's ex-wife had also accused him of being violent, but jurors were told the allegation was unproven.

On August 9 last year, Sylva was admitted to hospital after he took an overdose.

The day before the killing, the security guard told his brother Damian, a serving Signalman, he feared he would kill himself or someone else.

Giving evidence, Sylva said: ""I did not mean to kill her. I had deep feelings for her.

""When I slashed the knife across her throat at that split second I thought I had a mental breakdown.""

Psychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph told jurors Sylva suffered from moderate depression, but did not report having flashbacks of Iraq during the killing.

He said Sylva had told him they argued and she called him a ""good for nothing"" before threatening him with a knife.

The defendant claimed he must have lost control as he disarmed her, but said he could not remember the stabbing.

Dr Joseph questioned whether it had anything to do with being depressed, suggesting Sylva was ""pre-disposed to violence"".

He added: ""It may be his attack on Simonne is all to do with battling with feelings and angry outbursts leading to an enraged state of mind.""",newsdesk@birminghamlive.co.uk (James Rodger),https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/britains-talent-star-simonne-kerrs-16455641,2019-06-19 16:19:50+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Jordan Bassett can be seen surrendering himself to officers at a station after he blasted his pal at a flat in Chepstow Close, Willenhall, Coventry.

The 25-year-old was caught in the above bodycam footage as police came out to arrest him.

Just days before, on December 7 last year, Bassett had been 'messing around' with a gun and shot Addison Packeer in the head.

A witness described told the pair were talking about drugs before Bassett told the 27-year-old victim he had only paid him £200 of a £2,000 debt.

He heard a ‘pop’ and walked into the room to find Bassett with his arms around the Addison pleading: “Addi, addi, what’s happening? What did I do, what did I do?""

Police to spend £7 million on tackling knife crime and youth violence

Bassett threatened to kill that witness if he called police before he could flee the scene.

Armed police raced to the property to find the 27-year-old lying in a pool of blood on a settee in the living room.

He was pronounced dead at the scene, and Bassett was quickly identified as the killer.

Police launched a hunt for him, but before they could trace him, he handed himself in Little Park Street police station in the early hours of December 10.

He pressed the intercom button at the station and told officers he wanted to confess, but that it had been an accident.

According to Bassett, the 9mm Luger pistol had belonged to the victim, who had claimed that it was not loaded.

Bassett, of Tintagel Close, Willenhall, had been playing about with the deadly weapon when it fired.

Panicking, he tried to stem the flow of blood before riding his motorbike to a quarry in Willenhall to throw the gun and magazine into the water.

As he confessed to his crime, he told officers exactly where he had tossed the gun.

Within hours of the arrest, officers uncovered the firearm and a magazine containing a bullet.

Bassett admitted manslaughter, and today (June 24) at Warwickshire Justice Centre, he was found not guilty of murder.

He was found guilty of possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.

He will be sentenced on Wednesday, June 26.

Det Insp Caroline Corfield, who led the investigation, said: “We might never know exactly what happened in the flat, but the reality is that anyone who gets involved with firearms is putting themselves and others in serious danger.

""There is only one purpose to an illegally held, loaded handgun and that is to shoot someone.

“Sometimes the person shot is not the intended target.

""Here we have a man who has shot dead his best friend. Two families will have to live with the consequences of that for the rest of their lives.

63998,birminghammail--2019-06-30--Mums daily torment as daughters killer walks the streets,6/30/2019,birminghammail,Mum's daily torment as daughter's killer walks the streets,"The mother of a woman brutally murdered by her partner says she can’t get her daughter’s killer out of her head.

Tina Moore was just 30 years old when she was strangled by her then partner Toby Norris.

But her killer is now a free man after being released from prison.

And her mum Sonia says she thinks about evil Norris every single day, six months since he was let out.

Tina was found dead in a downstairs bedroom in her Uttoxeter home by her father, Kenneth, on October 4, 2003.

It was later revealed that the mother-of-two had been strangled by Norris following a night out.

The then 23-year-old was handed a life sentence in 2004 and served 12 years behind bars for the crime.

Sonia had campaigned for years against Norris’ release – but says that now he is free to walk the streets, she finds herself thinking about him all the time.

“He’s currently in a hostel down south but they won’t tell me any more than that,” she says.

“We’ve not had any problems with him, and I don’t think we will. It sounds like he has been behaving himself .

“But, of course, he’s going to be behaving himself – he wants to get out of the hostel.

“I hope he will continue to behave and that he has changed, but I have my doubts about him, and wonder whether he would come back around here.

“I honestly don’t know if he would. He is certainly hard-faced enough to, but he knows if he does he’ll go straight back to prison.”

Norris, from Chipping Norton in Oxfordshire, met Tina while he was working in Uttoxeter for a company that erected marquees for events.

On the evening before Tina’s death, the couple had been seen arguing. The row was over Norris meeting with a woman he had been seeing before he met Tina.

During a five-day trial at Stafford Crown Court, it was said the couple seemed to have smoothed it over and were later seen enjoying themselves at the former 9B bar, in High Street, Uttoxeter, before returning home.

When at home, however, the argument started again and Norris pushed Tina onto the bed, holding her by the neck until she died. He said he did not mean to kill her, but merely to “shut her up” during the argument.

When police arrived at the scene, Norris was nowhere to be found. He had fled to Belgium to escape capture but finally faced justice in 2004, when he was jailed for life .

Sonia and Kenneth have since raised their late daughter’s children, Tyler and Ben, but say they have never been able to move on.

She says she thinks about Norris every day, worrying where he could be, or if he may return to Uttoxeter.

The conditions of the killer’s release state that he cannot travel anywhere near Tina’s family.

If he visits Uttoxeter, Burton, Stafford, Derby or Stoke, he could be sent back to prison.

And Sonia admits part of her wants him to return to the area – purely so he will be put back behind bars.

“I am certainly going to keep tabs on him,” she says. “One of the family liaison officers told me that if I ever see him, I should take a photo of him.

“Now, I carry my phone on me at all times. I won’t go out of the house without it. I wouldn’t do that if it wasn’t for him.

“I never trusted him, and I don’t know if he will come back.”

A Parole Board spokesman said : “We can confirm that a panel of the Parole Board directed the release of Toby ­Norris following a hearing in October 2018.

“Parole Board decisions are solely focused on whether a prisoner would represent a significant risk to the public after release. The panel will have looked at a whole range of evidence, including details of the original evidence and any evidence of behaviour change. We do that with great care and public safety is our top priority.”",newsdesk@birminghamlive.co.uk (Beth Pridding),https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/torment-daughters-killer-walks-streets-16503121,2019-06-30 09:20:24+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64720,birminghammail--2019-07-19--Dad-of-two Tank shot to death in broad daylight - before killer went to pub,7/19/2019,birminghammail,Dad-of-two 'Tank' shot to death in broad daylight - before killer went to pub,"A dad nicknamed 'Tank' was gunned down in a hail of bullets - before his killer went to the pub.

Depraved Wade Cox has been jailed after shooting a dad-of-two dead in broad daylight.

The 29-year-old, from the North West, was found guilty of the senseless killing of Luke Graham.

Graham - known as 'Tank' - was gunned down in a hail of bullets in Ashton-under-Lyne.

The shooting, Manchester Crown Court heard, came as children played nearby last summer.

After murdering Mr Graham, Cox spent the night in his local pub.

Police say he acted 'as though nothing had happened'.

Four other men have been jailed in relation to the brutal murder, reports the Manchester Evening News.

A sentencing hearing heard that Cox lured Mr Graham and another man to a house in Ashton before shooting at them.

Mr Graham suffered a fatal gunshot wound to his shoulder but the other man survived, after being shot to the leg as he ran away.

He went to hospital, but discharged himself later.

Cox, who was wearing a balaclava and gloves, fired a total of five shots.

The court heard that Cox, as well as Mr Graham and the other man who arrived on Birch Street in a Volkswagen Caddy were all involved in drug dealing.

Cox claimed that Mr Graham had been dealing on his patch.

He hatched a plan to trick the man who was with Mr Graham into heading to the house on Birch Street, where Cox would lay in wait for his victim to arrive.

Prosecutors said it was more likely that the man with Mr Graham was the target of Cox's scheme.

Cox ordered addicts who lived in the house to call the man, and pretend they wanted him to come round to sell them some drugs.

When he arrived with Mr Graham, Cox burst out of the house and began shooting at them on June 13 last year, at about 4.50pm.

Sentencing, Mrs Justice Cutts said: ""This must have been a terrifying event. Gang violence had broken out in a place where young families lived.

""Mothers told of their fears for their children who were playing innocently in the street.""

The other man was shot to the leg, but was able to flee. Cox fired two more shots in his direction but missed.

He returned to Mr Graham, who lay on the floor dying, shooting at him again, but missed.

Cox fled to a house in Openshaw before being picked up by Jack West.

Benjamin Dodd was then told by Conor Cornforth to destroy the Audi.

Dodd set fire to the Audi later on a street near houses, managing to set himself on fire in the process.

He lied about how he suffered burn injuries to his hands and face when he went to hospital.

Cox was arrested in the early hours of the following day.

A jury at Manchester Crown Court spent two weeks considering their verdicts before finding Cox, of Rainow Avenue, Droylsden, guilty of murder and wounding with intent.

Another man, Jordan Atkinson, 26, of Stamford Drive, Stalybridge, was found guilty of encouraging or assisting an indictable offence and was jailed for eight years.

West, 29, of Parrenthorn Road, Prestwich; Cornforth, 27, of Calder House, Old Mill Wharf, Droylsden; and Dodd, 28, of Easton Road, Droylsden, were found guilty of assisting an offender.

West was jailed for 42 months, Cornforth received 37 months; and Dodd for 30 months.

In a victim impact statement read in court, Mr Graham's father Peter Graham said: ""Luke and his murder will be a part of my life forever. I was left numb and I will miss him.""

Just before he was murdered, Mr Graham passed his driving test, and his father said he felt that could have been a turning point for his son.

At the time of his death, Mr Graham said: ""Luke was a loving son, dad and brother, who was always there for his family and friends.

""He was the type of person who would go out of his way to help others and now we are broken as a family.

""We can’t believe that he’s gone and that he has been taken from us in such a horrific and cowardly act of violence.

""Losing Luke has devastated me as a father, and I wouldn’t want any other parent or family to go through the hell that I am living in at the moment.

""I would just like to thank the police for their tireless efforts in trying to piece together what has happened and would especially like to thank the community at Birch Street in Ashton where Luke passed away.

""People there risked their own safety and tried their best to save Luke when he was killed that evening.

""It is a great comfort to me as a dad that he did not pass away alone and that there were people there for him.""

After the hearing, Detective Chief Inspector Liz Hopkinson, of GMP’s Major Incident Team, said: ""This was a painstaking investigation to root out those involved in the brutal murder of Luke Graham and I would like to thank my team who have been dedicated to bringing those responsible to justice for over a year.

""After their despicable actions, Cox and West even dared to venture to their local pub in Droylsden later that evening as though nothing had happened, proving their callousness knew no bounds.

""As the Judge sentenced them today, she stated that they were part of an organised crime group who were selling Class A drugs and they were doing this to vulnerable people in the community on a daily basis, which is why I am glad we have removed them from our streets for some time.

""These men have ripped Luke from his family and friends in the cruellest way imaginable and I hope they can take some comfort from today’s result.

""A collective 53 years behind bars where there is no doubt in my mind that each and every one of them deserves to be.""","newsdesk@birminghamlive.co.uk (Andrew Bardsley, James Rodger)",https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/uk-news/dad-two-tank-shot-death-16616989,2019-07-19 16:57:45+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
64811,birminghammail--2019-07-21--How Birmingham public schoolboy turned into evil rapist and killer - and his links to Suzy Lamplugh,7/21/2019,birminghammail,How Birmingham public schoolboy turned into evil rapist and killer - and his links to Suzy Lamplugh,"He was the Sutton Coldfield schoolboy who appeared to have the world at his feet.

John Cannan was brought up in a respectable middle-class family who sent him to private school for the best possible start in life.

But the smooth-talking son of an engineer had demons - dark demons - which first surfaced when he was just 14.

It was in 1968 that the then teenager first attacked a woman, indecently assaulting her in a telephone box in Erdington.

The young offender was placed on probation but went on to join the Merchant Navy aged 17 before later leaving and becoming a car salesmen.

Yet that facade of respectability was destroyed when the charming but shirt-tempered Cannan embarked on a depraved crimewave through the early 1980s - which ended with rape, kidnapping and murder.

In 1981, he robbed a petrol station and a clothes shop at knifepoint and brutally raped a store assistant after threatening to stab her baby.

The former public schoolboy was jailed for eight years.

He was on day release from Wormwood Scrubs in London in 1986 when estate agent Suzy Lamplugh went missing.

In her work diary, the 27-year-old had written she was due to meet a mysterious Mr Kipper at a house - but she was never seen again.

An artist impression of Mr Kipper bore an uncanny resemblance to Cannan, who has always denied any involvement in her disappearance.

It was claimed that his nickname in prison was ""Kipper"".

Cannan was questioned by police regarding the disappearance of Suzy in 1989 and 1990 after he was jailed for life for the abduction and murder of newlywed Shirley Banks.

The 30-year-old had been on an evening shopping trip to Bristol when she vanished. Her naked body was later found at Dead Women's Ditch in the Quantock Hills in 1987.

There were rumours Cannan may have briefly dated Suzy and killed her when she tried to end the relationship.

Statements from her family and friends and his former lovers and fellow inmates  suggested the pair may have had a fling in the months before she vanished.

Cops believe Suzy may have been planning to tell him it was over when she vanished.

The much-loved daughter of Diana and Paul Lamplugh was officially declared dead in 1994.

In December 2000, Cannan was arrested again for her murder and questioned, but was not charged.

Two years later detectives said publicly that they believe he killed Suzy and confirmed this in 2006 when arguing against any reduction in his tariff.

Cannan subsequently complained via his solicitors about the police publicly naming him, saying he was ""devastated and distressed"".

Yet what is not in doubt is that Cannan is a cold-blooded killer, who targeted professional women.

He was given three life sentences with a recommendation never to be released for the murder of Shirley Banks, the attempted kidnapping of another woman on the previous night and the rape of a third woman in Reading in 1986.

And the evidence of his involvement in the disappearance of Suzy Lamplugh has grown over the years.

A former girlfriend Gilly Paige told police that he had once suggested the estate agent's body was buried at Norton Barracks, a former army barracks in Worcestershire, as they drove past.

Yet Cannan later wrote a letter to the local paper Sutton News denying the claims.

“May I please assure you, that whilst it is perfectly true that I did give ice-skater Gilly Paige a lift from Bristol to Birmingham, where both our families live, I did NOT at any time say that I had raped and killed Miss Lamplugh,” he said.

One of his fellow prisoners also told police that Cannan had buried the body of Suzy under the patio of his mother's former house in Sutton Coldfield.

A search of that property last year revealed nothing.

Human remains were discovered in a Worcestershire village last Friday - eight miles from where police had begun another search for missing Suzy.

West Mercia Police said they received reports of bones being found in the village of Kempsey.

Weeks earlier detectives had been searching for evidence of missing Suzy in Pershore - some eight miles away.

West Mercia Police later said the remains could be linked to the disappearance of a woman in 1982.

“This discovery is currently being treated as an unexplained death and we will be following many lines of enquiry,” the force said.

“Included within this is to establish if this is connected to the disappearance of a woman from the village of Kempsey in the 1980s.”

In a statement, the force added: “We are aware there is some speculation that this discovery may be linked to the disappearance of Suzy Lamplugh, who also went missing in the 1980s.

“Although we don’t believe it to be, until we have the post-mortem results we are not in a position to link the bones to any particular person at this stage and are keeping an open mind.”

Supt Damian Pettit, South Worcestershire’s Local Policing Commander said: “This is understandably a concerning discovery for the people living in and around the village of Kempsey. Thankfully, findings of this nature are very rare and I would like to take this opportunity to reassure the community that this is very unusual for the area.

“We are conducting a very thorough investigation and have multiple lines of enquiry to explore and one of which is into the disappearance of a woman from Kempsey that was launched in 1982.

“At this stage we don’t believe the remains to be connected to the Met Police’s missing person investigation for Suzy Lamplugh.

“Until we receive the post-mortem results we are not in a position to clarify any further details. I would like to reassure you that we are moving as fast as we can and will keep you informed with any significant updates.”

Meanwhile on Wednesday police said they had called off the Pershore dig after finding no new evidence.

Scotland Yard said in a statement: ""We remain committed to securing justice for Suzy and her family, and officers will continue to assess any new information received in connection with this case.



""Anyone that knows anything that could assist the investigation is asked to call officers on 0207 230 4294.""

As for Cannan, he is now 65-years-old and is unlikely to ever be freed from prison for the crimes he has proven to have committed.

The mystery of the disappearance of Suzy Lamplugh continues, a mystery police are determined to one day solve.",newsdesk@birminghamlive.co.uk (Tony Larner),https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/how-birmingham-public-schoolboy-turned-16598686,2019-07-21 04:30:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A teenager has been sentenced to 19 years in prison for stabbing Mohamed Sidali to death outside Joseph Chamberlain College. Louai Ali, 17, plunged a two pronged knife into Sidali’s chest in front of terrified students outside the gates in Belgrave Road, Highgate, on February 13. A security guard who tried to intervene and grab the knife was stabbed in the back.

Following a trial, the defendant, of Hodnet Grove, Highgate, was found guilty of wounding with intent, unlawful wounding and two charges of having an offensive weapon. This morning, he was jailed for a minimum of 19 years for his crime which have left Mr Mohamed’s family ‘devastated.’

Sentencing Judge Mark Wall QC said: “Your actions have left devastation In their wake. “Sidali’s loss has been deeply felt by his family and friends. “His mother has anxiety attacks and his brothers now fear going to school. “His death is described as leaving a huge void in their lives.”

Three men have been jailed after a vigilant CCTV operator saw them with a sawn-off shotgun on a busy shopping street in Birmingham. Armed cops were alerted and raced to Farnborough Road, Castle Vale , and arrested the group who had been handed the weapon from a BMW.

Jordan Kibuka, 19, and Darnell Duquesney, 20, had previously admitted possessing a prohibited firearm while Makenzie Blackburn, 20, was found guilty of the same charge.

Kibuka, of Hawker Drive, Castle Vale, was sentenced to six years and eight months detention after he had also pleaded guilty to possessing a class A drug with intent to supply. Duquesney, of Alcott Grove, Kitts Green , had also admitted possessing cannabis. He was handed a sentence of five years and one month. Blackburn was sentenced to five years and three months after also being found guilty of two charges of possessing a knife.

A drug dealer is now behind bars - after he came clean to his mum and dad after police busted him.

The dealer, from the Midlands, was caught by cops as police netted cocaine and cannabis. He has subsequently been jailed for three years - after being caught with more than £1,000.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard how Liam Frimpong had been preparing to bag the loose cannabis at his  Newcastle  home, reports StokeonTrentLive. But police carried out a search warrant and discovered the stash of drugs, along with a trail of text messages.

Now the 33-year-old dad, of Quinton Grove, Milehouse, has pleaded guilty to possession with intent to supply cannabis and possession with intent to supply cocaine.

A dangerous driver crashed his 'pool car' into a taxi carrying four people. The banned motorist, from the Midlands, went the wrong way up a street before crashing into a lorry and taxi.

It came as he tried to evade the police. Sean Hambleton was being chased by cops when they lost sight of him. He was careering along Lichfield Street, in Hanley, when he was spotted by officers.

They picked up the Vauxhall Astra again when it was nearing the A500 on the wrong side of the carriageway, reports StokeonTrentLive. Hambleton, of Preston Street, Smallthorne, then crashed into the two other vehicles.

Now he has been jailed at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court after pleading guilty to dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, and driving without insurance.

A monkey dust addict mum-of-two repeatedly stabbed a man in back during a vicious robbery after tricking her way into his home. And her partner sprayed the victim with lighter fluid, reports StokeonTrentLive , our sister title.

Wayne Ferns and Vanessa Malpass subjected a man to a vicious robbery which saw him sprayed with lighter fluid and stabbed several times with a kitchen knife. The pair tricked their way into the victim’s home before attacking him and stealing his property.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard Ferns - who tried to hide his identity by wearing a beanie hat fashioned into a mask - later told police he had gone to the house in Leek to ‘enforce a drugs debt’. The 40-year-old has now been jailed for seven-and-a-half years, while his accomplice Malpass received a four-and-a-half year sentence.

Prosecutor Richard McConaghy said the victim heard knocking on his back door on the night of the offence. He looked out to see 32-year-old Malpass and, mistaking her for someone else, went down to let her in.

A Burntwood man has been jailed for defrauding an elderly woman out of thousands of pounds. David Cope, aged 68, was sentenced to a total of 32 months at Stafford Crown Court after he pleaded guilty to fraud by false representation and theft at an earlier hearing.

He was sentenced to 16 months for fraud, with 16 months for theft to be served concurrently.

In a separate matter Cope was sentenced to a further 16 months for sexual offences. He pleaded guilty to causing a child to watch or look at an image of sexual activity and two further counts of attempting to cause a child to watch or look at an image of sexual activity. These offences were committed between in 2016.

The court heard that Cope, of Bells Lane, Boney Hay, had been entrusted with an elderly woman’s bank card to assist with purchasing small items such as sweets when she went into a care home.

A county lines gang flooding Warwickshire with drugs from Birmingham has been busted - and its members will serve 68 years in jail. Five men and two women were jailed for more than 44 years on Thursday, July 11.

The sentences, handed down at Warwick Crown Court, follow five men being jailed for more than 23 years back in November 2018 for their part in the operation. The jail terms come after an investigation by the Warwickshire Police Serious and Organised Crime Unit (SOCU).

Between February 2015 and November 2017, detectives identified 429 class A drug deliveries made by the gang into Warwickshire. The drugs had an estimated street value of more than £400,000.

The venture was headed by Meshach Duncan who recruited a team - including Mateuz Frasunkiewicz, Dajon Donaldson and Kirean Aldred - to ship the drugs into Warwickshire. Rebecca Mannix, Kyle Crossley and Debra Walsh were also recruited to help deal the drugs in the county.

A ""naive"" woman who took almost £3,000 in cash and a mobile phone to Holland to help an on-the-run killer has been jailed for two years. Melisa Birkinshaw pleaded guilty in June to perverting the course of justice by helping Tyrone Andrew after he had stabbed Reagan Asbury in the neck following a boxing match at Walsall Town Hall in 2017. Andrew, of St Helen's Street, Derby, fled to Amsterdam and then Spain but was jailed for 14 years in August last year after being found guilty of manslaughter.

Birkinshaw, formerly of Cavendish Court, Derby, looked at the floor but remained composed in the dock at Birmingham Crown Court on Friday as she was jailed. The 22-year-old admitted doing acts intending to pervert the course of justice between October and December 2017 by permitting her bank account to receive cash intended for Andrew, and giving money and a phone to him in Holland.

The court heard that Andrew was in phone contact with Birkinshaw while he was still in Walsall, and later met her outside her flat. She flew from Luton Airport to Amsterdam three days after the killing with cash that had been deposited into her building society account by associates of Andrew.

A drug dealer was caught with three air guns, two coshes and a knuckle-duster at his home - and has subsequently been locked up. The dealer was also found with pepper spray at his house in the Midlands. And police also discovered crack and heroin worth a staggering £2,400.

Khalid Jones left two police officers fearing for their safety after grabbing a pistol from a shelf when they called at his home. The female officers had to wait three minutes for armed police back-up to arrive at the scene, Stoke Crown Court heard. Jones, 26, of Minshall Street, Fenton, denied ever intending to threaten them with the weapon, according to StokeonTrentLive , our sister title.

He was subsequently arrested. Police recovered 12.8 grams of crack cocaine, with a street value of around £1,080, and 13.5 grams of heroin, worth around £1,350.

Prosecutor Paul Spratt said they also seized 18 boxes of diazepam, three mobile phones ‘which showed some indication of drug supply’ and a total of £4,000 in cash. Several weapons were found during the search as well, including two coshes, a knuckle-duster, three air weapons and pepper spray. They were items associated with his 'trade' as a dealer, Mr Spratt told the court.

Now Jones has been jailed for three years after admitting two charges of possession of class A drugs with intent to supply, possession of the diazepam and two counts of possession of a prohibited weapon.

A 20-year-old who was left needing more than 40 stitches after being brutally attacked in a pub in the Midlands has spoken out. Jack Robinson, 20, required stitches around his eye being viciously attacked inside a heaving pub in Staffordshire.

The joiner was on a night out with friends from the Potters Bar football team. Jack had to quit his job and faces more surgery in the next 18 months after being brutally glassed in a pub.

The Stoke City fan has spoken out after seeing his attacker - 25-year-old Christian Peach - locked up for two years at Stafford Crown Court, reports StokeonTrentLive. Jack, from Meir Park, has welcomed the sentence handed down to Peach, of Hemlock Road, Meir, after he pleaded guilty to a charge of wounding.

He said: ""There are no winners in this case. ""Both families have suffered and I'm just happy there's been a bit of justice given. ""It wasn't particularly about what he got, it was just that he paid for what he did. ""It's given me a bit of closure because it's affected my family and now we can put this behind us, deal with it and move on.""

This is the first picture of illegal immigrant Warsame Mohammed, who was part of a gang who stabbed a dad-of two following a row about a minor prang.

Tragic Zakir Nawaz, 21, died after being attacked in Highfield Road, Washwood Heath , in September 2016. His second child had been born just ten days earlier. Mohamed and two associates were in a vehicle that had earlier collided with the victim's hire car.

Mr Nawaz, from Stechford, was repeatedly kicked, punched and stamped on before being stabbed in the chest. He was pronounced dead at the scene minutes later while Mohamed, 23, pictured for the first time, and suspected knifeman Abdulahi Shire fled the country.

Fugitive Mohamed, who is understood to have gone to Holland, sneaked back into the UK and was arrested after police spotted him walking on the M40 in January. Mohamed, from James Turner Street, Winson Green, tried giving false details but checks revealed he was wanted over the murder and arrested.

He was due to stand trial for murder but pleaded guilty to manslaughter at a later stage. Mohamed was given a four-and-a-half year jail sentence for manslaughter and two years for violent disorder, to run concurrently at Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday.

A married police officer who sent sexual messages to vulnerable victims and contacted prostitutes while at work has been jailed for 14 months. Pc Palvinder Singh sent ""hundreds and hundreds"" of flirty messages to four victims, including ones about bondage and threesomes, a court heard.

Birmingham Crown Court was told that Singh sent naked pictures of himself to two women, including a selfie in the shower and one beside his locker at a police station. In a statement summarised by the prosecution to the court, one of the women he had formed a relationship with said he had treated his job ""as a dating agency"".

The 39-year-old Smethwick-based officer, who has been married for 16 years, invited one of the women to his family home to engage in sexual activity while his wife was away.

Jailing Singh, Judge Roderick Henderson told the disgraced officer: ""You have a fine record as a police officer over 14 years and you have thrown it away. ""Over five months you went off the rails and committed these offences. ""We give our police officers great power, not just legal powers, but influence.""

Three friends who appeared in a YouTube video glamorising drugs and guns have been jailed for a total of nearly 40 years. In the video, which has been viewed by more than 48,900 times, the Birmingham men rap about shootings, cash, drugs and the police .

A West Midlands Regional Organised Crime Unit (ROCU) investigation spanning three years led to their arrest, crown court trial and prison sentences.

Remi Carty first came to police attention in 2016 when he was caught with a loaded pistol in a Birmingham fast food restaurant. After his release from prison, he remained on licence and when detectives conducted a warrant at a property in Redhill Road, Northfield in September 2018, CCTV showed the 20-year-old fleeing the property in his socks as police arrived.

Officers found a large quantity of class A drugs, a loaded 9mm pistol, a sawn-off shotgun and ammunition in two bags in a shed in the rear garden. Fingerprint analysis also connected Carty’s friend - 21-year-old Shaun Barnhurst - to the find.

During the investigation a third man - Kyle Esty - retrieved items from a wheelie bin at Barnhurst’s address and between November and January 2019 the 22-year-old made several street-level drug deals.

A pervert pensioner has been JAILED - after getting a schoolgirl to perform a sex act on him. Phillip Thornton was told in court: ""There was a significant disparity in age."" The Midland OAP has been locked up for four years.

He incited the girl - who was aged between nine and 11 - to touch him sexually and perform the act. The abuse was reported years later and the 70-year-old denied the allegations, reports StokeonTrentLive, our sister title.

He went on trial at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court charged with indecent assault, indecency with a child and indecency towards a child. He was cleared of indecent assault and the jury could not reach a verdict on the indecency towards a child charge and a not guilty verdict was entered on that matter. But Thornton, of Burnaby Road, Sandyford, was found guilty of indecency with a child and has been jailed for four years.

Prosecutor Richard McConaghy said the victim can recall the defendant asking her to rub some powder on his private parts. The victim confided in her boyfriend years later and he called the NSPCC. She reported the matters to police in 2017.

A bungling burglar left his DNA at a garage during a break-in - helping him be rumbled by police.

Dim Craig Kirkland broke into the detached garage of a house in the Midlands. His burglary - which was his 25th offence - came while the homeowners were asleep. He stole power tools worth £1,590. Kirkland, 43, has been handed a two-and-a-half year prison sentence. He was traced by Staffordshire Police after forensic scientists discovered his DNA on the garage window.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard Kirkland has 124 previous offences on his record. The latest break-in - on High Lane - happened sometime between 11.30pm on October 21 and 8am the next day.

StokeonTrentLive, our sister title, reports his 30-month prison term will run concurrently to the two-and-a-half year custodial sentence he is currently serving after burgling a property in Fegg Hayes.

A son who battered his mother to death after flying into a rage over her drinking has been jailed.

Matthew Page claimed Mary Page told him to ""finish it"" after he kicked her in the face at the family home in James Street, Bilston, on January 31. He had exploded with rage when he came home to find his mother had barricaded herself in her bedroom - warning him not to come in because she was ""pissed"".

The 40-year-old forced his way into the room as she had previously tried to commit suicide while under the influence - but when he saw his mother worse for wear, he launched his attack, kicking and punching her before picking up a bedside cabinet and hitting the 68-year-old over the head with it.

Page, who admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, moved his mother onto her bed when he believed she was dead and began cleaning up the blood. Wolverhampton Crown Court was told Page had also covered his mother with a duvet and wrapped her head in a towel,  which he said he had done to spare his brother the distress.

Three Midland men have been jailed for a total of more than eight years after police spotted a local 'gopher' and busted a County Lines drugs ring in Wales.

Two men from Dudley and a third from Walsall travelled to Llanelli to take part in an operation to supply cocaine, heroin, synthetic cannabinoids ('spice') and cannabis. But they were caught after police spotted local man Damien Hearne, who was described in court as 'a gopher'.

Swansea Crown Court heard it was a ' County Lines operation ', where a telephone line referred to as Mitch was used to facilitate the sale of the drugs, WalesOnline reported . Ravi Talware, Daniel Higgins and Ben Walker all travelled from the West Midlands to the town in south west Wales to take part in an operation.

Talware, 29, of Quicksand Lane, Walsall, admitted two counts of conspiring to supply class A drugs and two counts of conspiring to supply class B drugs, along with having an offensive weapon. Higgins, 37, of Vauxhall Street in Dudley, admitted two counts of conspiracy to supply class B drugs, and one count of having an offensive weapon. Walker, 21, of Bath Meadow in Cradley, Dudley, admitted one count of conspiring to supply class A drugs. Hearne, 35, of Elizabeth Street in Llanelli, admitted two counts of conspiring to supply class A drugs and one count of conspiring to supply class B drugs.

An evil slavery gang which forced workers to live in squalid conditions reportedly supplied the nation’s biggest supermarkets with freshly picked groceries. Some of the biggest names in the industry - including Tesco, Asda, Waitrose, Sainsbury and M&S - all bought vegetables from firms that hired vulnerable men and women brought into the UK and controlled by the ruthless gang.

The huge gang collected around 400 drug addicts and alcoholics in Poland with the promise of good money when they got to England. But they were paid just 50p a day as the majority of their earnings from hard manual labour on farms, in factories and recycling centres were siphoned off, an investigation by the Sunday Times reported.

All the supermarket chains and other companies involved said they did not know the workers were being exploited. The Sunday Times said several became aware of the mistreatment only when it contacted them. There is no suggestion the firms were actively complicit.

Led by the Polish Brzeninsky family the criminal mastermind gang pocketed a staggering £2million. Now eight members of the Polish Roma gypsy gang have been jailed after two trials at Birmingham Crown Court.

A woman has been jailed after brazenly assaulting a police officer for the SIXTEENTH time.

Victoria Everill is back behind bars in the Midlands - after targeting a cop yet again. The abusive woman, aged 28, was jailed in August, 2018 and again in January. Over the years, she has racked up a catalogue of offences against bobbies since 2008.

Now Everill has been locked up yet again after admitting her third attack on police officers in the past 12 months, reports StokeonTrentLive . Magistrates at North Staffordshire Justice Centre heard police arrested the defendant on the evening of April 29.

Prosecutor Emma Lineton said: “Officers noticed she appeared to be under the influence of alcohol. She was unsteady on her feet and her speech was slurred.

A ""trusted"" Birmingham teacher who abused two young girls has been jailed for ten years. One of the youngsters said Iain McDowall robbed her of her innocence and ruined her childhood.

The 47-year-old, of Willow Avenue, Edgbaston , was found guilty after a trial of two charges of sexual assault on a child under 13 and another serious sexual charge. He was jailed at Birmingham Crown Court and also ordered to register as a sex offender for life.

The crimes happened between 2008 and 2010 when the defendant was working at a city school. The court heard McDowall was "" utterly trusted by his colleagues .""

The abuse of one of the girls only came to light in October 2017 when she revealed what had happened in a letter to her mother. In a statement read to the court, the other girl said she now felt aggression towards men.

A sick robber has been jailed for more than six years after targeting two pensioners - pulling gold earrings from one while she shopped.

Lukeny Pedro grabbed an 83-year-old woman from behind in a shop and pulled her gold earrings from her ears, a court heard. Five weeks before, he robbed a pensioner on a bus, grabbing an £1,100 gold chain from round his neck.

Pedro, aged 24, of Sydenham Road, Smethwick, pleaded guilty to two charges of robbery and one of fraud at Warwick Crown Court. Judge Peter Cooke jailed him for a total of six years and eight months.

Prosecutor Ian Speed said on April 17 a 73-year-old Asian pensioner, who suffers from Parkinson's, was targeted on a bus at Pool Meadow bus station in Coventry. He had his gold chain and pendant pulled from round his neck by Pedro, who ran from the bus with it. Later that day, police were contacted by staff at H&T Pawnbrokers to say that a man had just sold them a chain with a distinctive pendant.

Firefighters were forced to tackle a 'full-on' blaze after an arsonist barricaded himself in a wardrobe.

The arsonist, high on monkey dust, locked himself away and torched his clothes in staggering scenes. He thought 'people were after him', a court in the Midlands heard.

The fire caused £4,250 damage - and the defendant's parents paid for the repairs. Adam Shaw barricaded himself inside the wardrobe in the middle of the night and used the flame from a lighter to illuminate it.

Now, StokeonTrentLive reports the 38-year-old has been jailed for 28 months following the blaze at the terrace property on Stanton Road. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard firefighters were faced with a 'full-on fire' after the defendant called 999 at 3.20am on November 17. He had escaped the blaze through a window.

A rapist who had been hunted by police for almost 20 years was finally arrested on board a flight to Pakistan moments before it was due to take off, a court heard.

Mohammed Ibrar Aslam, 47, from Sutton Coldfield, had been a wanted man after he attacked a drunk woman in 2001 who had earlier been snatched off the street. Despite extensive inquiries at the time of the shocking attack, he remained at large for nearly two decades, a court heard.

West Yorkshire Police’s Cold Case Review Team began a new inquiry last year following advances in forensic science. Following a huge and time-consuming investigation, Aslam, aged 29 at the time of the rape, was identified as a potential suspect for a DNA test.

Information about Aslam had been circulated via police and E-Border systems, a court heard. Police finally got their man on January 8 this year after officers from the West Midlands found him on board an Emirates flight at Birmingham International Airport.

In February he pleaded guilty to the rape charge after his DNA matched samples taken from the victim 18 years. Aslam, of Birmingham, was jailed for 11 years and three months at Leeds Crown Court.

The 39-year-old walked towards the retired victim while wielding the blade as she stood outside her Newcastle flat, reports StokeonTrentLive. She and a friend managed to seek refuge in her home and call the police.

Officers arrived to find the defendant huddled on the floor before seizing the blade and arresting him.

Now Vella, who is a long-term drug user and has mental health issues, has been jailed for 12 months and made the subject of a five-year restraining order which prevents him having any contact with his former neighbour.

Prosecutor Antony Longworth told Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court the woman was waiting for a neighbour outside her flat at Stoneyfields Court, Sandy Lane, Newcastle, at 9pm on August 25 when she became aware of the defendant.

A student who branded himself ‘Diablo the MDMA dealer’ has been jailed. The Midlands man has been caged after he was caught by police. Cops found hundreds of pounds worth of ecstasy and cannabis.

The 22-year-old was caught with a stash of cannabis and some scales in his girlfriend’s room at Keele University. Dawit Tekle fled the complex, reports StokeonTrentLive , our sister title. And the next day university staff intercepted a package addressed to him which contained hundreds of pounds worth of class A drug MDMA (ecstasy).

The defendant was tracked down at Southampton University a few weeks later when he was in possession of £5,500. His phones were analysed and showed he was involved in the supply of MDMA.

Now Tekle has been jailed for two-and-a-half years at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court. Prosecutor Paul Spratt said two security officers at Keele University went to the defendant’s girlfriend’s room at 3.30pm on November 23, 2017 after receiving a report someone was smoking cannabis.

64952,birminghammail--2019-07-25--Chilling CCTV of teen killer calmly walking to popular park to rape and murder girl,7/25/2019,birminghammail,Chilling CCTV of teen killer calmly walking to popular park to rape and murder girl,"This is the chilling moment a youngster calmly walks to a Wolverhampton park to brutally rape and murder a 14-year-old girl.

In the footage, which was released by West Midlands Police, Ayman Aziz is captured on CCTV travelling towards West Park to violently kill Viktorija Sokolova.

The warped 17-year-old lured the Lithuanian-born youngster to the park under the pretence they would 'smoke weed and talk' on April 11, 2018.

But only today are we able to report this, after courts lifted restrictions on revealing the killer's identity .

Wolverhampton Crown Court had heard that he intended to have sex with Viktorija and had searched for sexually explicit content online beforehand.

Aziz subjected the schoolgirl to horrific levels of violence in a two-hour attack after she refused his advances.

He was caught on CCTV as he attempted to cover up the offence by hiding bloodied clothing, having deleted Facebook messages and hurled his victim's phone towards a lake. 



Detectives believe he used a hammer, which has never been found, to launch the assault on his victim - who suffered a fractured skull, brain injuries and shattered vertebrae.



 Throughout his trial, Aziz showed no remorse, gave no evidence in his defence and simply nodded as he was ordered by the judge to be taken to the cells. 



Aziz could not be identified in reports at the time as reporting restrictions because of his age were imposed.

Although the trial judge agreed to lift those restrictions following an application by PA and other media organisations, the teenager's lawyers challenged that decision and the restrictions remained in place pending an appeal.

Adam Kane QC argued the reporting restrictions should not be lifted because they would have an adverse effect on Aziz's rehabilitation.

He also said the teenager, who has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, has been ""bullied and threatened"" in detention and has stopped attending educational classes as a result.

But the Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and two other senior judges rejected Aziz's challenge at the Court of Appeal on Thursday, meaning he can now be named.

The judges also rejected an appeal by Aziz, who watched the hearing over a video link from the young offenders' institution where he is detained, against his minimum term. 



Detective Inspector Caroline Corfield, who worked on the case, described the scene as one of the most shocking and brutal murders officers had ever seen.

She said: “It’s one of the most shocking murder investigations that I have never worked on.

“She was 14-year-old, she went to the park that night to meet someone she called a friend. But he has murdered her in an explicitly violent attack and then degraded her by dragging her body from the initial site of the attack and leaving her stripped, half-naked, over a park bench to be found by a dog walker the next morning.”",newsdesk@birminghamlive.co.uk (Jordan Coussins),https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/black-country/chilling-cctv-teen-killer-calmly-15544060,2019-07-25 15:40:19+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
65295,birminghammail--2019-08-01--Dads hell at never meeting daughter murdered by killer mum Louise Porton,8/1/2019,birminghammail,Dad's hell at never meeting daughter murdered by killer mum Louise Porton,"The devastated dad of two girls murdered by their mum has told of his heartbreak after 'never even meeting' his youngest daughter.

Louise Porton was today, August 1, convicted of murdering her two young daughters after they ""got in the way"" of her sex life.

Porton had denied killing three-year-old Lexi Draper and 17-month-old Scarlett Vaughan, but was unanimously found guilty by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court on Thursday, after a five-week trial.

Porton blinked as the verdicts were read out and then sat in the court dock, one hand over her eyes, head bowed.

The 23-year-old suffocated Lexi in the early hours of January 15 last year and was then heard ""laughing"" at a funeral parlour two days before killing Scarlett just over two weeks later, on February 1.

In a heartbreaking statement, released by Warwickshire Police, dad Chris Draper said he was 'heartbroken' to learn of Lexi's death, having only spent a 'short time' with her.

Just two weeks later, he learned his younger daughter, Scarlett, had also died.

""When we lost Lexi we were heart broken and couldn't believe she had gone. Then we were devastated to hear about Scarlett,"" Chris said.

""Only having a short time with Lexi and never meeting Scarlett makes it all the more heart breaking.

""We will miss out on all those special occasions they would have celebrated. Their first day at school, birthdays, getting married and having children of their own.

""The loss of Lexi and Scarlett has not just affected the immediate family, but also all those who were part of their lives.

""The only comfort is that Lexi and Scarlett are together.

""We would like to thank everyone for their support and help.""

During the trial, harrowing details emerged about the death's of the young girls and the behaviour of Porton.

Jurors heard Porton had accepted 41 friend requests on a dating app just a day after the first child Lexi died, and was described by prosecutors as being ""calm and emotionless"" following Scarlett's death.

When Lexi was ill in hospital, just over a week before she died, Porton took topless photos in the toilets and was arranging to perform sex acts for money with a man she had met through a website.

Prosecutors said it had appeared to the funeral arranger present that Porton was ""using FaceTime and that she was speaking to a man"".

Jurors were told that after police seized her phone, they uncovered searches including how long it took a dead body ""to go cold up to the shoulder"" and ""five weird things that happen when you die"".

Opening the Crown's case at the start of the trial, prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC said: ""The overwhelming inference is that Lexi and Scarlett died because someone deliberately interfered with their breathing.

""That someone can only have been this defendant.""

Both children had symptoms consistent with deliberate airway obstruction and Scarlett had signs of recent bleeding in her neck tissue, suggestive of neck compression, jurors heard.

Mr Saxby said specialist doctors could find no ""natural reason"" for why either child had died.

Almost two weeks before her death, Lexi had been taken to hospital on January 2 and then January 4, but was sent home with antibiotics for an apparent chest infection.

Prosecutors said that while in hospital with her sick daughter, Porton went to the toilets and took topless photos.

It was in the days after Lexi was discharged on January 4, the prosecution alleged the mother looked online for ""can you actually die if you have a blocked nose and cover your mouth with tape"".

Porton also searched ""how long after drowning can someone be resuscitated?"" and accessed an article called ""Toddler brought back to life after nearly drowning"", jurors heard.

The Crown alleged Lexi had been dead for some time before a 999 call was made from her home on January 15, with Mr Saxby pointing to evidence of Porton's web searches.

After Scarlett's fatal collapse, Porton told police it was ""entirely false"" to suggest the toddler was already dead when she was recorded on CCTV carrying the little girl from a hotel, in Rugby, where she had been staying.

But the paramedic responding to the subsequent non-emergency 111 call Porton made, described the girl being ""freezing and completely lifeless"" when he arrived.

CCTV showed Porton filling up with petrol during the period when jurors heard Scarlett had already died.

The first day of trial was told that from August 2016 until early November 2017, Porton lived at an address in Willenhall, near Walsall, where her landlady spent ""more and more time"" caring for Lexi and Scarlett while their mother was ""doing social things"" instead of looking after them.

The landlady made a statement to police saying Porton was doing ""whatever she could not to have them with her"".

Conceding that being a young mother of two young children would have placed a burden on the defendant, Mr Saxby added: ""No doubt, she would have needed time to herself.

""But, in the context of what was later to happen - in the context of two unexplained deaths consistent with deliberate airway obstruction - it is hard not to draw the conclusion that, for the defendant, at times, her two children got in the way of her doing what she wanted, when she wanted and with whom she wanted.""

Porton had denied wrong-doing throughout, telling police in a prepared statement: ""My children were never an inconvenience to me and I accommodated my lifestyle and personal life around them.

""I still don't know how my daughters died, or what caused it.""

Porton, 23, was today (August 1) found guilty of the murder of daughters Lexi Draper and Scarlett Vaughan - who died just two weeks apart.

She was convicted after a five-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

Lexi, three, was pronounced dead by paramedics at the family home in Beechwood Court, Rugby in the early hours of January 15 last year. Porton called an ambulance saying she had found Lexi lifeless in her bed after going in to check on her.

Following Lexi's death the Sudden Unexpected Death in Infancy and Childhood procedures (SUDIC) were followed by professionals.

Porton claimed that on the evening of February 1, she had set out to take Scarlett to the hospital after she had fallen ill.

On her way to the hospital she pulled over in the car park at Elliott's Retail Park in Rugby to call an ambulance.

Scarlett was taken to hospital where she was pronounced dead.

In audio released by the Crown Prosecution Service, Porton can be heard calmly speaking to an ambulance service operator - claiming daughter Lexi was unconscious and not breathing.

Ambulance service: ""This is the ambulance service, is the patient breathing?""

Ambulance: ""Who are we talking about?""

Porton: ""Lexi, she is three""

Ambulance: ""She's three? OK. She's unconscious and she's not breathing? Help has been arranged OK?""

Almost two weeks before her death, Lexi had been taken to hospital on January 2 and then January 4, but was sent home with antibiotics for an apparent chest infection.

The body of Gary Cunningham, 29, was discovered by a delivery driver outside her home in Harborne, Birmingham.

He had been stabbed by Olivia Labinjo Halcrow TWELVE times and bled to death.

The 26 year-old previously been acquitted of murder but was found guilty of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility by a jury at Birmingham Crown Court.

The court heard that Labinjo Halcrow had been Mr Cunningham's on and off girlfriend and had a young son from a previous relationship.

Text messages between the pair suggested there had been a history of physical violence between them.

Labinjo Halcrow lived in a block of flats in Frensham Way and in the early hours of February 23 a neighbour had heard ""banging and screaming"".

Mr Cunningham had gone out in the morning to a garage but he was later found propped up against a fire exit door with blood around him.

One of the wounds he suffered had severed an artery below his left knee and he had bled to death.

Kate Bex QC, prosecuting, said there was evidence that both had been on drink and drugs before the killing and said that the defendant had been three and a half times over the alcohol limit for driving when the victim died.

Ali Bajwa QC, defending, said Labinjo Halcrow suffered from a depressive illness and had no memory of the stabbing.

He claimed that she had been subjected by Mr Cunningham to a controlling and manipulative relationship.

In passing sentence Judge Simon Drew QC said: ""On the morning of 23 February after consuming large quantities of alcohol you attacked Gary Cunningham.

""I accept that your relationship with him was a volatile one, punctuated by episodes of violence. However I do not accept that was only one way.

""It also became clear to me as the trial progressed that you are someone who can be bullying, manipulative, prone to exaggeration and if necessary lies, in order to get your own way.""

He added: ""In my judgement the degree of responsibility retained by you was somewhere between medium and high.

""I accept you may not have been aware of the fact that Gary Cunningham was bleeding to death on the landing outside your flat.

""However not only did he suffer multiple injuries but he also sustained 12 separate wounds.

""The fact that some of them were relatively superficial suggests that the attack went on for some time, therby prolonging the suffering.

But the detective who investigated the tragic case said that Proctor, who was today jailed for two years and ten months for manslaughter

Paul Proctor, 47, of Priestland Road, Shard End, had already served an 18 month custodial sentence back in 2002 after pleading guilty to a charge of wounding following an attack on Mark Wilkie outside The Tyburn pub, in  Castle Vale , on August 6, 2000.

Mr Wilkie was left for dead in a sickening assault where he suffered a horrific brain injury from a single brutal punch. He was just 27 and never fully recovered.

Mark was left in a wheelchair and needing round-the-clock care, before he finally succumbed to his injuries in October 2017.

His close-knit family were torn apart by the attack and his mum, Lilly, died just two months after him.

Following Mark's death from pneumonia, linked to a head injury, Proctor - of Priestland Road, Shard End - was charged again with manslaughter and pleaded guilty to the offence at Birmingham Crown Court back in August.

Today he was starting another period in custody after being sentenced to two years and ten months.

Detective Inspector Jim Colclough, who led the investigation, said Proctor hadn't shown any remorse following Mr Wilkie's death.

He said: ""As a result of the sad death of Mr Wilkie in October 2017 we reopened the case and due to medical evidence we were able to link his death with Paul Proctor and the one punch he inflicted on Mr Wilkie on that day. We were then able to secure a manslaughter charge.

""Following Mr Wilkie's death Proctor was brought into the police station. He had served a custodial sentence of 18 months back in 2002 for wounding. As a result of his death we spoke to Proctor. He was clearly shocked facing a manslaughter charge 17 years after Mr Wilkie's death.""

DI Colclough said Proctor's actions had turned the lives of Mr Wilkie and his family upside down.

He added: ""This brutal act had a devastating affect on Mr Wilkie and his close family. He was left with a brain injury and required long term care for his injuries. This now brings closure and some kind of justice for Mr Wilkie's family.""

Speaking exclusively to Birmingham Live  Mark's sister Claire Hazel said said her family's lives had been shattered by the unprovoked attack, and they were 'struggling to come to terms' with the events of the past two decades.

She said: ""We put our lives on hold - the attack destroyed our family.

""I half expected him to go back to being the Mark we all knew and loved, but he never recovered and was left severely disabled and needing 24-hour care.

""He had no quality of life and to this day, we still can't believe it happened.

""It had a huge affect on our mum and the rest of the family. We would go to hospital every day and sit with him, I'd take my son who was only one at the time and I'd only leave when it was time to fetch my daughter from school.

""I did it out of sisterly love - Mark was my only brother and he was wonderful. He was kind, caring, loving, thoughtful and a real family man.""","newsdesk@birminghamlive.co.uk (Charlotte Paxton, Andy Richardson)",https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/killer-paul-proctor-shocked-faced-17025731,2019-10-03 15:19:26+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mum Sarah Handley was left with fatal head injuries in the back of the vehicle - but cowardly Paskin fled the scene in Handsworth , leaving her to die.

Paskin was jailed for over nine years at Birmingham crown court on Wednesday (October 16).

The 35-year-old, of no fixed address, pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving, driving while disqualified and driving with no insurance.

It happened as Paskin fled from officers in his Ford Fiesta after being spotted on the M6 on the evening of Saturday August 17.

His vehicle had already being involved in a police pursuit earlier that day which was abandoned by officers due to his dangerous driving.

After leaving the motorway, Paskin realised he was being followed and made off at speed.

He drove on pavements in excess of 70mph and ran two red lights. The pursuit was again abandoned as it was considered too high risk.

Sadly within a minute of the pursuit being abandoned Paskin’s Fiesta was found on Crocketts Road, where it had collided head on with a WV Golf at the junction with Junction Road.

Paskin ran from the scene, leaving his girlfriend, 28-year-old Sarah Handley, in the back of the car. Tragically Sarah died shortly after in hospital from head injuries sustained in the collision.

The three people in the WV Golf all received hospital treatment for minor injuries.

Six hours after the collision Paskin handed himself in to police and was arrested for causing death by dangerous driving.

He was today given a 14 year sentence reduced to nine years and four months for his guilty plea at Birmingham Crown Court.

The force’s Professional Standards Department was informed as well as the Independent Office for Police Conduct, as is normal procedure in a collision where a police vehicle is involved, who are conducting an investigation.

Sergeant Dean Caswell, from the Serious Collision Investigation Unit, said: ""This is such a tragic case, Sarah was a much loved mother, daughter, sister and aunty.

""She was taken in such horrific circumstances and my sympathy remains with her family at this extremely difficult time.

""Paskin’s behaviour was persistently dangerous on two occasions on that day, the judge describing it as a deliberate act.

Campbell was jailed for life after snatching Alesha MacPhail from her bed on the Isle of Bute before raping and murdering the six-year-old last summer.

Argyll and Bute Child Protection Committee carried out a review following the crime, which said Campbell, then 16, had been known to the authorities and was twice referred to the Youth Justice Service.

His offending was considered low-level, however, and did not warrant the implementation of the authority's Sexual Harmful Behaviours Protocol.

The report was produced in June but not published in full due to data protection laws.

A summary, which refers to Campbell as ""X"", said: ""The review has established that those professionals working with X were not aware of concerning behaviours that would have raised concerns for those professionals working with X.

""The review group are of the view that there was no indication that agencies could have foreseen or predicted X's offending behaviour.""

The group commended the response of the local secondary school head teacher and staff in helping Campbell's fellow pupils come to terms with the crime.

The report said: ""Initially, some pupils could not believe that X had committed the offence and could not accept this up until the point where he was found guilty and sentenced.

""The head teacher sensitively and effectively managed an exceptional set of circumstances and worked with colleagues from educational psychology and Rape Crisis to provide support and counselling to pupils and staff.""

Alesha, from Coatbridge in North Lanarkshire, was staying with her grandparents and father Robert MacPhail on her school holidays when she was preyed on by Campbell on July 2 last year.

The teenager, who the High Court in Glasgow heard had previously bought cannabis from Mr MacPhail, tried to incriminate his partner, Toni McLachlan.

Campbell was found guilty and sentenced to a minimum term of 27 years in jail, reduced to 24 years following an appeal.

The review group included representatives from Argyll and Bute Health and Social Care Partnership and Police Scotland.

The committee found evidence of good communication between the island's social work team and education services, which it said had ""played a key role as named person in supporting and monitoring X"".

It ruled out carrying out a significant case review.

Alesha's uncle, Calum-John MacPhail, told the Daily Mail: ""There should be a full investigation to find out if opportunities were missed to save Alesha.

""We had no idea before this that there were any markers or concerns about Campbell - apart from unconfirmed rumour - and I'm angry about that.

""There has to be a full significant case review and we need to find out what happened to prevent any future tragedies.""

Cleland Sneddon, chairman of Argyll and Bute chief officers group for public protection, said: ""Our drive is to do all we can to protect children.

""We therefore went beyond what is required from an initial review and carried out a thorough, multi-agency assessment of what happened.

""This robust process has evidenced that a crime of this nature could not have been foreseen.""

He added: ""Given the extensive and thorough nature of the multi-agency assessment, it is our view that the initial review has covered everything that would be expected to be assessed by a significant case review.

""We will use the work of our initial review to support ongoing development of child protection practices.

""Our thoughts continue to be with Alesha's family and everyone affected by her loss.""",newsdesk@birminghamlive.co.uk (James Rodger),https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/alesha-macphails-killer-aaron-campbell-17372511,"Thu, 5 Dec 2019 21:58:45 +0000","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To date, Little has confessed to 93 murders. The FBI’s Violent Criminal Apprehension Program (ViCAP) can also confirm that Little has been matched to 50 cases, with many more pending final confirmation.

In 2012, Little was arrested and extradited to California on a narcotics charge. Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) obtained DNA that connected Little to three unsolved homicides that occurred in 1987 and 1989. In 2013, the LAPD notified ViCAP, which initiated a full background investigation and found an alarming pattern that linked Little to many more murders. Little was charged with three counts of murder and ultimately convicted and sentenced in 2014 to three consecutive life terms without parole.

In May 2018, the Texas Rangers and the FBI were able to obtain detailed information on additional murders across the country that Little voluntarily provided.

Little says he strangled his 93 victims between 1970 and 2005. Many of his victims’ deaths, however, were originally ruled overdoses or attributed to accidental or undetermined causes. Some bodies were never found.

“The FBI is grateful for the Texas Rangers and state and local law enforcement partners who have worked diligently to confirm these cases,” said John Selleck, assistant director of the FBI’s Critical Incident Response Group. “Strong cooperation and information sharing between the FBI and its partners resulted in successful connections to Little’s crimes, ultimately bringing him to justice and helping victims’ families through the closure process.”",----,https://breaking911.com/breaking-fbi-confirms-samuel-little-is-the-most-prolific-serial-killer-in-u-s-history/,"Mon, 07 Oct 2019 18:33:59 +0000","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
70705,breaking911--2019-11-24--14-Year-Old Killer Charged As Adult In ‘Brutal’ Slaying Of Susan Spiller,11/24/2019,breaking911,14-Year-Old Killer Charged As Adult In ‘Brutal’ Slaying Of Susan Spiller,"MINNESOTA — Adult criminal murder charges were filed against a teenager after a Hennepin County District Court judge ordered he should be tried as an adult, even though he was just 14 at the time of the murder.

Demetrius Wynne, who will turn 19 on Thursday, was charged with second-degree murder with intent and second-degree murder while committing a felony (burglary) in the July 2015 death of 68-year-old Susan Spiller in her home at 5120 Dupont Ave. N. He is expected to make his first court appearance on the adult charges Thursday.

Wynne was arrested and charged by juvenile petition in the murder on June 21, 2019. However, nearly all information, including Wynne’s identity, was not public because he was a juvenile at the time of the murder and would continue to be treated as one even though he was 18 at the time of his arrest.

The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office immediately filed a petition to have Wynne certified as an adult. Closed juvenile court hearings were held before Hennepin County District Court Judge Tanya Bransford on Sept. 18 and Oct. 22 with final written comments submitted by Oct. 29. She ruled in favor of adult certification Tuesday, noting that his age precluded him from being treated as a juvenile and even Extended Juvenile Jurisdiction would only keep him on probation for two years.

“We appreciate Judge Bransford’s decision and believe it is the correct one to protect public safety,” Freeman said. “This was a home burglary and brutal killing and by no stretch of the imagination would two years be sufficient for either punishment or rehabilitation. Now we will focus on proving Mr. Wynne guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.”

According to the new adult criminal complaint, Wynne and his family lived next door to Spiller at 5116 Dupont Ave. N. Sometime in the evening of July 15-16, 2015, someone cut the screen to a rear window of Spiller’s home and removed it to gain entry into the house. Spiller was found in her bedroom where she had been beaten, strangled and stabbed five times. Her cell phone was missing.

The break in the case came on June 12, 2019 when Wynne was booked and fingerprinted on an adult felony case, which is pending. Two days later, the computer matched his booking fingerprints to prints taken from the rear window of Spiller’s home, the complaint states. In addition, a DNA profile from a fingernail clipping from Spiller’s right hand has been connected to Wynne.

FOX 9 reported after her killing that Spiller had spoke at a community meeting, saying she feared retaliation after reporting neighborhood problems such as noise complaints.",----,https://breaking911.com/14-year-old-killer-charged-as-adult-in-brutal-slaying-of-susan-spiller/,"Sun, 24 Nov 2019 19:25:56 +0000","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
72041,breitbart--2019-08-22--Florida Serial Killer Who Targeted Gay Men to Be Executed,8/22/2019,breitbart,Florida Serial Killer Who Targeted Gay Men to Be Executed,"Gary Ray Bowles, 57, is scheduled to receive a lethal injection Thursday evening at Florida State Prison in Stark, Florida, the Associated Press reported.

Florida Today reported that Bowles was sentenced to death row in 1996 for murdering six men he met on a trip up and down the East Coast between March and November 1994.

Because he picked up most of his victims in gay bars between Daytona Beach, Florida, and Maryland, he earned himself the nickname “the I-95 killer.”

He often offered his victims money or sex before strangling them to their deaths, taking their identification and credit cards. Bowles was featured on America’s Most Wanted on five different occasions and made the FBI’s most wanted list in 1994, shortly before detectives questioned him on his last murder, Walter Hinton.

Bowles was raised in abusive household, causing him to leave home at 14 and earn his keep by working as a prostitute, letting gay men perform sex acts on him in exchange for money.

Despite his violence towards gay men, Bowles has said he is straight. He also had a history of violence against women.

In 1982, Bowles was convicted of brutally beating and sexually assaulting his girlfriend in Tampa. He served less than three years for that crime. She suffered severe injuries from his beatings.

After a second prison stint for robbery and grand theft, Bowles went back to working as a prostitute in Daytona Beach and moved in with another girlfriend. The relationship faltered when she found out he was a sex worker, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported.

Bowles later told the police he blamed gay men for his breakup, and that was why he targeted gay men for his killing sprees.

Police caught Bowles in Jacksonville in November 1994 several days after he murdered his sixth victim, Walter Jamelle Hinton, the Washington Post reported.

In his confession to police, Bowles said he murdered six men in four states and dropped a concrete block on Hinton’s head while he slept. Bowles pleaded guilty to murder in court and received the death penalty in 1996. The Florida Supreme Court reversed the death penalty in 1999, due to improper handling of his case.

Bowles was re-sentenced to death in a court hearing that same year. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a warrant for Bowles’ death sentence on June 11.

Barring a stay of execution by Florida’s Supreme Court, Bowles will die by lethal injection Thursday evening.",Katherine Rodriguez,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/_LmIZEoKNMg/,2019-08-22 19:40:49+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Holland said he was able to get through to Little by agreeing with him that he was a killer and not just a rapist. His interrogation tactic enabled Little to present detailed, vivid memories of each woman he killed.

“There’s indications of visualization, of when he’s thinking about a crime scene. He’ll start stroking his face. And as he’s starting to picture a victim, you’ll see him look out and up,” Holland said.

“And you can tell he has this revolving carousel of victims, and it’s just spinning, and he’s waiting for it to stop at the one that he wants to talk about,” he added.

Little also had the ability to sketch out the likenesses of the women he killed, creating a collection which Holland showed in the 60 Minutes interview.

The FBI released those drawings back in February to get help in identifying some of Little’s victims. Little is currently incarcerated and serving three life sentences, which has led him to be forthcoming with investigators around the country.",Katherine Rodriguez,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/Exeo-lYxmko/,2019-10-05 19:56:02+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
75250,"breitbart--2019-11-06--Sanctuary County: Illegal Alien Killer Escapes Jail Time, Gets Freed into U.S.",11/6/2019,breitbart,"Sanctuary County: Illegal Alien Killer Escapes Jail Time, Gets Freed into U.S.","An illegal alien who was convicted of killing a man while driving drunk earlier this year escaped jail time and was instead freed into the United States.

In January, illegal alien Jose Barajas-Diaz was driving drunk when he hit and killed Miguel Angel Linarte Jacome, an immigrant from Mexico. Immediately after Barajas-Diaz’s arrest, the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency requested that, should he be released at any time, he be turned over to them for detainment.

In October, Barajas-Diaz was convicted for Jacome’s killing and given a five-year prison sentence, but all of it was suspended and he was given credit for time served, allowing him to be immediately released.

Rather than turning Barajas-Diaz over to ICE agents for deportation, the Mecklenburg County Sheriff’s Office released the illegal alien into the general public and forced ICE agents to go and arrest him days later.

This is yet another example of a clear public safety threat being released into North Carolina communities rather than into ICE custody due to local sheriff policies on ICE non-cooperation. Continued decisions to refuse cooperation with ICE serve as an open invitation to aliens who commit criminal offenses that these counties are a safe haven for persons seeking to evade federal authorities, and residents of Mecklenburg County are less safe due to these misguided sanctuary policies.

As Breitbart News reported, North Carolina sanctuary jurisdictions freed more than 500 criminal illegal aliens back into the general public in Fiscal Year 2019. Up to 80 percent of criminal illegal aliens freed back into American communities by sanctuary jurisdictions go on to commit more crimes.

El Paso Sector agents assigned to the Ysleta Border Patrol Station arrested Miguel Marines-Patino, a Mexican national, after he illegally crossed the border south of the Padres Overpass on November 7. The agents observed the man illegally crossing the border about two miles west of the Ysleta Port of Entry, according to information obtained from El Paso Sector Border Patrol officials.

The agents arrested the man and transported him to the Ysleta Station for processing, including a biometric background investigation. During the investigation the agents uncovered and immigration and criminal history, officials stated. A court in Chicago convicted Marines-Patino in 1986 on a charge of murder. The court sentenced the Mexican migrant to 24 years in state prison. Immigration officers twice removed the migrant, most recently in March 2016.

“Federal authorities in El Paso filed a federal criminal complaint this morning charging Marines-Patino with illegal re-entry after deportation,” El Paso Sector officials stated. “Upon conviction, Marines-Patino faces up to 20 years in federal prison.”

“Every day, criminal aliens attempt to illegally enter the United States, often concealing themselves among family units or taking advantage of the current crisis,” officials stated. “The men and women of the U.S. Border Patrol are our first line of defense in stopping these criminals before they can wreak havoc in communities all over our country.”

Elsewhere on the border, San Diego CBP officers arrested four felons in three days as they attempted to enter the U.S. from Mexico.

On November 6, officers assigned to the Otay Mesa pedestrian facility observed a woman approaching for inspection from Mexico. Officers identified her as Roxana Salazar, a 26-year-old U.S. citizen. A database check revealed the woman is wanted by the San Bernadino Sheriff’s Department to face a charge of murder. The warrant carries a bond of $1 million, officials stated.

Two days earlier, CBP officers assigned to the San Ysidro PedWest facility apprehended another U.S. citizen wanted for murder in Los Angeles, San Diego CBP officials stated. The man attempted to cross the border on November 4. Officers check the man’s identity against the database and uncovered the active warrants for charges of murder and attempted murder, officials stated. Deputies turned Joey Alvarado, 32, over to U.S. Marshals for transportation to the San Diego Central Jail.

Officers assigned to the San Ysidro PedWest facility arrested the two men wanted for escaping from the jail located in Salinas, California. The two men, 21-year-old Santos Fonesca and 20-year-old Jonathan Salazar, both U.S. citizens, presented themselves for inspection by CBP officers. The officers ran a background check and found the warrants from the Monterrey County Sheriff’s Department for jail escaped.

Jose Rodriguez-Cruz, 53, was indicted by a Stafford County grand jury for the May 1989 murder of 28-year-old Marta Haydee Rodriguez. Rodriguez-Cruz is currently serving a 12-year prison sentence for the 2009 murder of his girlfriend, Pamela Butler, who was a federal worker in Washington, D.C.

During a Friday press conference, Stafford County Commonwealth’s Attorney Eric Olsen announced that the former military police officer, who was discharged after threatening to harm his female superior twice, has been charged with first-degree murder and the unlawful concealment of his wife’s body, finally bringing a 30-year investigation to a close.

“This is the ultimate act of domestic violence and it’s noteworthy that in the month of October justice is going to be delivered for Marta Rodriguez,” Olson said, pointing out that October is Domestic Violence Awareness Month.

Rodriguez was last seen on May 1, 1989, as she walked to a bus stop after leaving her job as a nurse’s aide. Prosecutors allege Rodriguez-Cruz murdered his first wife shortly after she told police he had assaulted and kidnapped her—but before she could testify against him in court.

“If I can’t have her, no one will,” Rodriguez-Cruz once said, according to 2017 court documents.

The 28-year-old’s body was found in 1991 on an Interstate 95 median but was not positively identified until last year.

Twenty years after his wife’s 1989 disappearance, Rodriguez-Cruz fatally strangled Butler, an Environmental Protection Agency analyst and his girlfriend of seven months, during a heated argument before hiding her body. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in 2017, at which point he confessed to killing the 47-year-old in her basement in 2009 before slipping her body out of a first-floor window.

One of Rodriguez-Cruz’s friends told authorities that he once said it was “easy” to get rid of a body because “if you dig a hole deep enough, no one will find it,” according to testimony at his plea hearing. As part of his plea deal, Rodriguez-Cruz told police he buried Butler in 2009 along Interstate 95—where Rodriguez was found—but her remains were never discovered.

Derrick Butler, Pamela’s brother, also attended Friday’s news conference and told reporters he was relieved to hear news of Rodriguez-Cruz’s latest charge.

Authorities believe his pattern of abuse stretches beyond the death of his two former lovers. In 2017, investigators testified that the 53-year-old told his second wife he knew how to make sure a body was never found. Another woman, a security guard at a federal office, also told detectives that Rodriguez-Cruz allegedly duct-taped her wrists, held a gun to her head, and sexually assaulted her in 2004.

“This man doesn’t impulsively kill. He abducts women, duct-tapes them, sexually assaults them, and then holds them captive,” said Assistant U.S. Attorney Glenn Kirschner said at the 2017 hearing. “Duct tape and a gun are his weapon of choice.”",Pilar Melendez,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/thedailybeast/articles/~3/yETBrQQaDYM/jose-rodriguez-cruz-va-man-who-killed-his-girlfriend-now-charged-in-estranged-wifes-murder-prosecutors,"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 17:18:31 GMT","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
126051,dailybeast--2019-11-26--UIC Student’s Alleged Killer Was ‘Angry’ She Ignored His Catcalls: Prosecutors,11/26/2019,dailybeast,UIC Student’s Alleged Killer Was ‘Angry’ She Ignored His Catcalls: Prosecutors,"A man who sexually assaulted and strangled a University of Illinois at Chicago student to death over the weekend became “angry” at the young woman when she “ignored” his catcalls, prosecutors said in court Tuesday.

Donald Thurman, 26, was charged on Monday with first-degree murder and criminal sexual assault for the grisly Saturday night slaying of 19-year-old Ruth George. George, a sophomore kinesiology major, was found “unresponsive” in the backseat of her family’s car on Saturday morning after her family reported her missing to campus police.

In Cook County court on Tuesday, prosecutors alleged Thurman saw George across the street and started catcalling her. The student didn’t respond and kept walking—which made the 26-year-old “angry he was being ignored,” Assistant State’s Attorney James Murphy said.

Once inside the parking lot, prosecutors said Thurman grabbed George and placed her in a chokehold before throwing her into the backseat of her family’s car. He then allegedly sexually assaulted the teenager with a condom on while she was unconscious.

Police say Thurman, who lived near campus but has no affiliation with the university or the victim, confessed to killing the student just hours after he was arrested. In 2016, he was sentenced to six years in state prison for an armed robbery after allegedly stealing a woman’s iPhone and fleeing in a stolen vehicle. He was released last year and is currently on parole, jail records show.

George’s family members said Tuesday that they hold “no hatred” toward their loved one’s alleged killer as they “grieve with hope.”

“Our hope is no other girl would be harmed in this way and for a mother to never experience this type of heartache,” the family said in a statement. “Ruth lived out her deep faith in Jesus by loving and serving others, leaving a legacy of Christ-centered kindness and sacrifice. She was the beloved baby of our family.”

According to university surveillance cameras, Thurman was walking behind George as she entered the garage around 1:35 a.m. on Saturday. About 35 minutes later, he can be seen running south on Halsted Street, away from the scene.

George’s family contacted campus police at around 11 a.m. on Saturday after they had not heard from her in two days. Police said the teenager’s cell phone “pinged” off a Halsted Street garage on campus—where they found her dead in the backseat of the family-owned car.

At around 2 a.m. on Sunday, detectives picked up Thurman at the Halsted and Harrison station and took him into custody. After about 12 hours of police questioning, he “gave a full confession to this horrific crime,” authorities said.

Thurman’s attorney argued to Judge Charles Beach on Tuesday that his client is homeless with a history of childhood abuse and suicidal ideations. Despite her request for protective custody—noting death threats he has received since his arrest—Beach ordered Thurman to be held in Cook County jail without bail.

Hundreds of UIC students gathered Monday night to mourn the young woman who dreamed of becoming a physical therapist, hanging dozens of yellow ribbons around campus in her memory. George was a 2018 graduate of Naperville Central High School, where she was a member of the school’s gymnastics team.

“It is very difficult to find words that can express the sadness our entire community experiences today following the news of the tragic death of a 19-year-old undergraduate student,” UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis said in a statement. “We offer our sincere condolences to the student’s family and friends and I know that all of us have them in our hearts as they struggle with this devastating loss.”

In several social media posts, George’s family and friends recalled the teenager as “the sweetest person” with the “brightest smile.”

“She was the light of our family and the best of all of us,” Esther George, her older sister, wrote on Facebook. “She was wise beyond her years and now she is gone [too] soon. God give us peace.”

The office of Gov. Ron DeSantis says 57-year-old Gary Ray Bowles was pronounced dead at 10:58 p.m. Thursday after receiving a lethal injection at Florida State Prison in Starke.

He was condemned to die for his murder conviction in the 1994 slaying of Walter Hinton in Jacksonville Beach. That was one of the six known killings that terrorized the Interstate 95 corridor that year and earned him the nickname of the ""I-95 killer.""

Hinton was Bowles' sixth victim in the killing spree that began in Daytona Beach with the slaying of John Hardy Roberts. In between, there were victims in Maryland, Georgia and Florida. In each case, Bowles stuffed the victims' throats.

The U.S. Supreme Court has cleared the way for the execution of a Florida serial killer who targeted older gay men in a spree a quarter-century ago.

The justices denied the last-ditch appeal Thursday of 57-year-old Gary Ray Bowles, whose lawyers had claimed he is too intellectually disabled to be executed. Bowles was to die by lethal injection late Thursday at the Florida State Prison in Starke.

Bowles was condemned for the murder of Walter Hinton in Jacksonville Beach - one of the killings that terrorized the East Coast's Interstate 95 corridor in 1994.

The execution was scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday but was delayed while the Supreme Court considered his case.

Bowles was condemned for the murder of Walter Hinton in Jacksonville Beach - one of the killings that terrorized the East Coast's Interstate 95 corridor in an eight-month span in 1994.

Hinton was Bowles' sixth and final known victim in a spree that began in Daytona Beach with the slaying of John Hardy Roberts. In between, there were victims in Rockville, Maryland; Savannah, Georgia; Atlanta and Nassau County, Florida.

A serial killer who preyed on older gay men during a rampage that left six dead a quarter century ago received no visitors in the hours before his planned execution.

Officials at Florida State Prison in Starke say 57-year-old Gary Ray Bowles did eat a meal of three cheeseburgers, French fries and bacon as execution preparations were being made. He's set to receive a lethal injection for the murder of Walter Hinton in Jacksonville Beach - one of the killings that terrorized the Interstate 95 corridor in an eight-month span in 1994.

146361,drudgereport--2019-04-06--OJ Prosecutor Darden Defending Suspected Nipsey Hussle Killer,4/6/2019,drudgereport,OJ Prosecutor Darden Defending Suspected Nipsey Hussle Killer...,"— An aspiring rapper plead not guilty Thursday in the murder of hip hop artist Nipsey Hussle in South Los Angeles.

Eric Ronald Holder Jr., 29, was arraigned in a downtown Los Angeles courtroom on one count of murder, two counts of attempted murder and one count of possession of a firearm by a felon.

If convicted as charged, he faces a possible maximum sentence of life in state prison.

Holder is represented by Christopher Darden, the former city prosecutor from the O.J. Simpson murder trial in the mid-1990s, according to CBSLA’s Dave Lopez.

Holder could face a potential life prison sentence if convicted as charged, according to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office.

Hussle, whose real name is Ermias Joseph Asghedom, was fatally shot Sunday in the 3400 block of West Slauson Avenue.

The Grammy-nominated rapper was gunned down outside The Marathon Clothing, a store he opened in 2017, in the Hyde Park neighborhood just south of the Crenshaw area where he was born and grew up. Two other men were also wounded in the attack, although only one of them was hospitalized.

According to LAPD Chief Michel Moore, Holder and Hussle became involved in some sort of dispute outside the store before Holder left and returned with a handgun. Hussle was shot in the head and body and died at a hospital, officials said.

“We believe this to be a dispute between Mr. Hussle and Mr. Holder,” Moore said. “I’m not going to go into the conversations, but it appears to be a personal matter between the two of them.”

Holder is being held on $5 million bail.",,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/DrudgeReportFeed/~3/5RfFzGUyVqs/,2019-04-06 10:37:37+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
151829,drudgereport--2019-10-04--Serial Killer Confesses to 93 Murders,10/4/2019,drudgereport,Serial Killer Confesses to 93 Murders!,"James Holland has heard confessions from many, many murderers. But now one is telling the Texas Ranger he's committed 93 murders himself, making him perhaps the most prolific serial killer in American history. The race is on to identify all of the 93 women Samuel Little says he murdered, while the 79-year-old remains alive and continues to cooperate.

 

Holland tells Sharyn Alfonsi in his first television interview how he got Little to open up about his victims for a story to be broadcast on ""60 Minutes"" Sunday, October 6, at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.

 

Information Holland has gathered from Little has led to 50 cold case murders being solved. There are more Little says he committed that if resolved would give victims' relatives answers and exonerate any innocent people who may have been wrongly convicted for the murders.

 

Holland says he broke through to Little by agreeing with him that he was not a rapist, but truly a killer. This tack seemed to unlock the place where he kept detailed, almost photographic memories of every woman he killed. Holland describes Little's process, ""There's indications of visualization, of when he's thinking about a crime scene. He'll start stroking his face. And as he's starting to picture a victim, you'll see him look out and up."" 

 

""And you can tell he has this revolving carousel of victims, and it's just spinning, and he's waiting for it to stop at the one that he wants to talk about,"" Holland says.

Little can count all of his victims, even still hear them, says Holland. A big aid in identifying victims has been Little's ability to sketch very close likenesses of the women.

The web designer has been at large since being convicted in his absence of manslaughter by gross negligence in July last year.

Shepherd, 31, was sentenced to six years in jail after being found culpable over the death of Miss Brown, 24, in a speedboat accident on the Thames in December 2015.

Detectives say he may be using secret bank accounts belonging to friends or relatives to finance his life on the run.

Shepherd was given permission to challenge his conviction by a judge at the Court of Appeal on December 19.

Shepherd’s passport was not confiscated before the trial.

Detective Chief Inspector Mick Norman, from the Met, told the Daily Mail that “Shepherd is subject to an international arrest warrant. However since he failed to appear in court for his trial there has been no tangible trace of him.”

Mr Norman added that despite being in touch with his London solicitors, there had been “no tangible trace” of Shepherd.

His lawyers, who are funded through legal aid, insist they do not know where he his.

“There have been a number of rumours that he is being harboured abroad by friends but we have no evidence this is the case,” Mr Norman said.

“There has been no movement on his bank accounts or phone. However this is only in respect of the accounts we are aware of.”

He added: “He may well be using the accounts of friends or family associates to evade arrest and extradition.

“We would also appeal to Mr Shepherds friends and associates who may be assisting him to do the right thing and share any information.”

A Metropolitan Police spokesman told the Daily Mail: “Shepherd’s passport was not seized by the police or the court as he was on court bail and fully complying with bail conditions up to the time of the trial when he failed to appear.”

Ms Brown's parents, Graham Brown and Roz Wickens, told the BBC they did not want to comment on the appeal until after 22 January, when they will meet Home Secretary Sajid Javid to discuss efforts to trace Shepherd.

They have previously said it was ""not fair"" Shepherd had not faced justice.

Russell Jordan Jones, 23, was standing on a street corner talking to friends when he was ambushed by four masked men brandishing knives and a 12-bore shotgun.

Mr Jones fled for his life but stumbled and was shot and then stabbed 12 times in a “merciless” attack. One of his friends was also knifed in the back but survived.

On Friday Judge Mark Dennis QC jailed two of the killers, Bilkan Bilkaner, 20, and Duke Quainoo, 21, for life and ordered that they both serve at least 29 years behind bars.

He said Mr Jones and his friends were not associated with gangs and had been “picked on at random” by the killers who wrongly believed they were rivals simply because they were standing together on a street corner.

At the sentencing hearing Mr Jones’s mother, Stephanie Saunders, said she believes unanswered questions about her son’s murder will “haunt me forever”.

“I would give my life in a heartbeat for Russell to have his back. Every day is pure torture”, she told the Old Bailey. “This is just the beginning of a life-long sentence, I will never be free from the pain and grief.”

She told the court her son was months away from completing a business management degree at the University of Hertfordshire and it was awarded posthumously following his murder.

Mr Jones had been out for dinner with friends on March 16 last year and was in South Street in Edmonton just after midnight when he was attacked.

Bilkaner, Quainoo, and two other men — who have not been caught — had spent an hour driving around the area looking for potential targets.

Judge Dennis said: “This was a shocking and brutal attack without a motive beyond the desire to cause death and serious injury to others.”

Bilkaner, from Edmonton, and Quainoo, from Enfield, both denied but were convicted at trial of murder, causing grievous bodily harm with intent and possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life.

When the jury returned its verdicts last month and cleared a co-defendant of the attack, Bilkaner and Quainoo violently attacked the third man in the dock. However, they both showed no emotion as they were sentenced over videolink from prison on Friday.",Tristan Kirk,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/mother-of-victim-says-she-ll-never-be-free-of-pain-as-killers-are-jailed-a4038291.html,2019-01-14 12:16:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Graham Brown spokes of his overwhelming emotion after speedboat killer Jack Shepherd, 31, was arrested in Georgia after months as a fugitive.

Ms Brown died after going on a date with Shepherd where they went out on his boat during a date in December 2015.

Her father welcomed the news of Shepherd's arrest and called on him to ""atone"" for what happened.

He said: ""My opinions towards Jack Shepherd is that he's a very crass, reckless man, who managed to abscond and stick two fingers up at the judiciary.

""He's got to come back to atone for all that and I think that he's done the right thing and thank goodness he's realised that now and handed himself in.

""It's been quite hard over the last three years.""

Shepherd had been on the run since before his trial and conviction for the manslaughter of Charlotte Brown

His trial started last July and he was eventually convicted for manslaughter by gross negligence of 24-year-old Ms Brown who was killed after he took her on a date on his speedboat.

He disappeared before his trial started in July and was sentenced to six years in jail in his absence at the Old Bailey having skipped bail and fled the UK.

Shepherd had denied manslaughter ahead of his trial.

Images from Georgian broadcaster Rustavi 2 appear to show a heavily-bearded Shepherd smiling and calmly handing himself in.

He was also interviewed on screen as he did so.

On Wednesday, Shepherd's legal representative in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia said Shephered had handed himself in because ""he was ready to prove he was innocent"".

Shepherd told reporters from the Georgian broadcaster that he was ""in a tragic accident.""

He married his childhood sweetheart following Ms Brown's death and had a child but he is now estranged from his wife.

Katie Brown, Charlotte's sister, voiced surprise over Shepherd's ""smug"" appearance on clips aired by a Georgian TV channel.

She told BBC News: ""I feel very surprised at how smug he looks to be honest.

""It just shows a very arrogant man.

""I don't understand how someone can go on the run for two crimes and be found guilty and still then just walk straight in with a very smug look on his face and claim innocence. It's unbelievable.""

Wearing a long coat, jeans and a checked scarf, he smiled and waved for cameras as he walked into a police station on Wednesday.

A spokesman for the country's embassy in London said that Shepherd had surrendered to the police.

Home Secretary Sajid Javid, who a day earlier warned ""there can be no hiding place"" for Shepherd, celebrated his arrest.

""We will seek to swiftly extradite him to Britain. It is vital Charlotte Brown's family see justice done,"" he added.

Georgian law states that extradition is granted over convicted individuals if they have been sentenced to at least four months' imprisonment.

While Shepherd was on the run from the law, his lawyers have been working to appeal against the conviction.

Solicitor Richard Egan: ""In the light of today's developments I don't think it would be appropriate to comment further until Mr Shepherd is back in the jurisdiction.""

Ms Brown died in December 2015 after being thrown from Shepherd's speeding boat.

This happened during a champagne-fuelled late-night jaunt past the Houses of Parliament and Shepherd's Old Bailey trial heard that he had met Ms Brown on a dating website.

The court was told he had been trying to impress her at the end of their first date at the Shard.

After handing her the controls, the boat hit a submerged log and capsized, sending Ms Brown into the cold water.

The teenager is facing life behind bars for brutally killing the six-year-old girl after snatching her from her bed during a holiday to her grandparents' on the Scottish isle of Bute.

Campbell was found guilty of murder yesterday, and will be sentenced next month for the ""bestial"" crime which is believed to have been inspired by the Slender Man horror character.

Today Judge Lord Matthews agreed that Campbell’s name and picture could be published for the first time, after an appeal by media organisations to end his anonymity.

He said: ""I can't think of a case in recent times that has attracted such revulsion.

""I intend to grant the application. The press may name the accused and publish images of him.""

Following yesterday’s guilty verdict, the judge said Campbell had committed “some of the most wicked and evil crimes this court has ever heard of in decades of dealing with depravity”.

The judge added that he still has “no idea” of the motive for the murder, which prosecutor Iain McSporran QC has described as “bestial”.

Alesha was snatched by Campbell as she slept on July 2 last year, inflicting horrific injuries, raping the young girl, and then dumping her lifeless body in woodland.

During the trial, Campbell cruelly tried to pin the blame on Alesha’s father’s girlfriend, who was forced to deny in court having anything to do with the shocking crime.

Ultimately jurors took just three hours at High Court in Glasgow to find Campbell unanimously guilty.

In a statement issued by Police Scotland, Alesha's family said: ""We can't believe that we will never see our wee angel Alesha again. We miss her so much.

""We hope that the boy who took her from us is jailed for a long time because of what he has done to our family.""

Mark Barton made the plea after Jack Stevens, 19, was sentenced to life with a minimum 23 years after he was found guilty of murdering new father Nashon Esbrand in Islington in August 2017.

Stevens was the ringleader of a gang which was captured on CCTV chasing Mr Esbrand, 27, on bicycles. Mr Esbrand was eventually cornered just yards from his parents' house when another teen stabbed him to death with a machete-style blade.

Stevens fled the country after the murder but was extradited from Spain last summer and brought to justice at the Old Bailey. Three of his accomplices have already been jailed over the murder.

Gangs co-ordinator Mr Barton told the Standard after the sentencing: ""It’s pure relief. It took a year to find him and nearly a year to convict. It’s satisfying as he was the ringleader. He showed no remorse at all.

""There was a lot of family in court. This brought the sadness back again. But we will keep fighting for Nashon by doing something positive. We are going to do a ‘happy Nash day’ community event every August 25, the day of his death.""

But Mr Barton added: ""It’s still raw. I wish I was there to protect him.

""And there have been so many murders and stabbings since that day.

“These people have no appreciation for life, and no appreciation for themselves. It’s a disease in our communities that needs to be sorted. It’s not just on the police: communities need to get together and take responsibility.

“I will continue to support young people. I don’t want to see families go through what we went through with Nashon.""

On August 24, 2017, Mr Esbrand and his girlfriend were walking down Essex Road with their baby, Milla, who was born nine days before.

Minutes after they parted company, Mr Esbrand was spotted by Stevens and Dillon Zambon, then aged 18 and 19. They targeted him because Mr Esbrand had previously spoken to police about another incident.

Stevens and Zambon chased Mr Esbrand back up Essex Road and enlisted the help of three other youths: Jhon Berhane, then aged 17, a 15-year-old boy who cannot be named and another male who has not been indentified.

They cornered Mr Esbrand in Mitchison Road before the 15-year-old stabbed him in the legs, causing fatal blood loss. One of the wounds was 17.5cm in depth and he died the following day. It happened in a doorway a few doors down from his parents’ house.

In June last year, Zambon and Berhane were both sentenced to life, with the 15-year-old given 12 years. All three were convicted of murder.

Three to four weeks after the murder, Stevens fled the UK in the boot of a car travelling to Belgium, from which he travelled to Spain. He was extradited to the UK in August last year after the Met obtained a European Arrest Warrant.

A jury found Stevens guilty of murder earlier this month and he was sentenced on Friday.

Judge Anuja Dhir said Stevens showed a ""chilling lack of remorse"" and told him: ""Without you this senseless murder would not have taken place.""",James Morris,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/nashon-esbrand-murder-brother-of-islington-stab-victim-calls-for-london-communities-to-take-a4097786.html,2019-03-23 07:45:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eric Holder, 29, had been on the run for two days before he was arrested in Bellflower, Los Angeles, about 20 miles from where the musician was killed.

He was detained first by sheriff's deputies until LA Police arrived and confirmed he was wanted over Hussle's killing.

It was not immediately clear how authorities located the suspect, but a statement posted on LAPD HQ's social media thanked the ""community for the heightened awareness/vigilance"".

It read: ""Eric Holder, the suspected killer of Nipsey Hussle, has been arrested and is in police custody. Thank you to both our community for the heightened awareness/vigilance, and our partners at @LASDHQ.""

Officers had released Holder's name and photo on Monday and asked for the public's help in finding him.

Police Chief Michel Moore told the Associated Press Hussle and Holder knew each other and are thought to have had some kind of personal dispute in the hours before the rapper was killed.

The 33-year-old musician was shot and killed outside his clothing shop on Sunday. Two other people were shot but survived, the Los Angeles Police Department said.

A post-mortem examination found Hussle was killed by gunshots to the head and torso, according to the Los Angeles County Department Medical Examiner-Coroner.

The death was certified as a homicide, the coroner added.

Beyonce was among those to pay tribute to Hussle, who was nominated for the best rap album Grammy earlier this year for Victory Lap.

Ramanodge Unmathallegadoo, 51, was armed with two crossbows, a hammer and a knife, as well as cable ties and duct tape when he burst out of the garden shed at the home of his 35-year-old ex-wife Sana Muhammad, it was said.

He wanted to kill both his ex-wife and her new husband Imtiaz Muhammad, it is alleged, but was disturbed as he lay in wait for the perfect time to strike.

The jury was told Unmathallegadoo went for the “principal target” of Ms Muhammad, who was eight months pregnant, allegedly waiting until he had her “in his sights” before firing the crossbow bolt into her chest and piercing her heart. She was killed but her unborn son was saved by doctors.

Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said Unmathallegadoo had been plotting the attack on November 12 last year for more than a year, carrying out surveillance on his ex-wife’s new home in Ilford and identifying the shed as the ideal place to hide.

He said Unmathallegadoo had stashed a “cache of weaponry”, including two crossbows near to the house prior to March last year, but they were accidentally stumbled upon by a neighbour and he had to replenish his stock before carrying out the killing.

Mr Wright told the court Unmathallegadoo had wed Ms Muhammad, also known as Devi, in an arranged marriage when she was 16, but the union had broken down by 2012.

He said: “This was a deliberate and quite calculated act of revenge on his part, intended to cause at the very least the death of Devi and the extinction of the child she carried.”

He went on: “For at least a year he had been making preparations for an attack upon Devi and Imtiaz. The attack that took place on the morning of November 12, 2018 was the culmination of a series of acts carried out by him, all of which were calculated to ensure a successful outcome to what was to be a devastating and murderous attack as an act of revenge on his former wife and her new partner.” He added: “The disintegration of his marriage had had a profound effect upon him and his life which eventually led to a deeply held desire for a most violent revenge.”

The jury heard that on the morning of the shooting, Unmathallegadoo, a former site manager at Newham General Hospital, had taken up an “ideal vantage point” in the garden shed where he could watch the house.

However Unmathallegadoo was disturbed in the shed at about 7.30am by Mr Muhammad and “had to seek to execute his plan as best he could”, running past him in search of his ex-wife, it was said.

“Imtiaz then ran through the back door which led to the kitchen, shouting for Devi to run,” said Mr Wright. “The two ran from the kitchen into the corridor which led to the front door, with the defendant in close pursuit. Devi turned and ran up the stairs, whereas Imtiaz ran out of the front door.

“Imtiaz saw the defendant, who was at the bottom of the stairs, shoot Devi who was halfway up the stairs. The effect on her was immediate and she fell to the floor.”

Mr Wright said Unmathallegadoo later told a police officer he had shot his ex-wife by accident while aiming at Mr Muhammad.

But Mr Wright said: “If he wasted his first bolt on Imtiaz he may not succeed with his one remaining loaded crossbow to kill his principal target Devi. That, we say, is the reason why he did not shoot at Imtiaz in advance of the successful attack upon Devi.”

Unmathallegadoo, of no fixed address, denies murder and attempted child destruction.

Michael Adebowale, 37, is currently behind bars in HMP Wakefield, but he is believed to be seeking a prisoner-swap deal.

Adebowale, who is serving a 45 year jail term for the 2013 murder, was born in Britain but has Nigerian parents.

A source told The Sun: “Michael hates Wakefield. It’s stuffed full of lags who see him as a top target.

“He thinks he can spend the rest of his sentence in Africa.”

The newspaper reported that Adebowale has written to immigration experts asking for advice.

But it is thought that his bid would fail because he was not born in the West African country.

Adebowale was moved to HMP Wakefield, a high security prison dubbed “Monster Mansion”, last year

He and Michael Adebolajo hacked Mr Rigby, 25, to death by his barracks in Woolwich, south-east London.

The Fusilier’s mother Lyn Rigby reacted to Adebowale’s bid, describing it as a “disgrace and an insult to Lee”.

The appeal came as Elyon Poku’s father said he is haunted by seeing his son dying in a hospital bed. Tony Poku only had five final minutes with his 20-year-old son, also known as DJ Nana Banger, before he passed away.

Police have offered the reward for information leading to the conviction of Elyon’s killers at a house party attended by 200 people in Stamford Hill last September.

Mr Poku, 58, said: “Elyon was our only child and our reason for living and somebody has taken that away for nothing.

""He’d only just returned from performing in Los Angeles and he was happy. Elyon said he was going to the party on the Friday night.

""But at 1am on Saturday his cousin rang and said, ‘Get dressed, Elyon has been stabbed’. When I got downstairs, the police car was there already.

""They took me to the hospital... I thought he was sleeping. Less than five minutes later, that’s it — he’s dead.”

Mr Poku added: “We are desperate to get justice for our son.” Elyon wanted to be a social worker and was due to start university.

Nine arrests have been made as part of the investigation, with six people released under investigation.

Nikos Metaxas, 35, was led into a Nicosia court under heavy security and stared at the ground as a prosecutor read out a string of charges, including kidnapping and the killings of five women and two of their daughters, age six and eight, from the Philippines, Romania and Nepal.

Metazas, who is believed to be Cyprus’s first serial killer, broke down in tears as the indictment was read.

“Cypriot society will be wondering how one of its members reached this point. I have also asked myself why; I have not yet managed to find an answer,” he said.

Police say Metaxas met the women online. The victims were mostly employed as housekeepers on the island and disappeared between September 2016 and August 2018.

The case triggered outrage and horror on an island where serious crime is relatively rare.

The police chief was sacked and the justice minister resigned following accounts of bungled investigations by police who did not take the disappearances seriously because the women were foreign.

The first victim was found dead by tourists shooting pictures at a mining shaft in late April, unravelling the macabre killing spree. The last victim discovered, the six-year-old child, was found in a lake on June 12. Sentence was expected to be passed later today with Metaxas facing seven life terms.",MIchael Howie,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/cypruss-first-serial-killer-admits-threeyear-murder-spree-a4174531.html,2019-06-24 10:30:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Charles Riddington, 37, was arrested on the island last August, nearly two years after the frenzied attack on George Barker, 24, at a gym in Bexley.

Riddington, who was said to be friends with ex-footballer Jamie Redknapp, had accused Mr Barker of “going behind his back” over a drugs debt before punching him and stabbing him 17 times, as people with Riddington warned terrified onlookers “not to get involved”. At the Old Bailey yesterday he was found guilty of murder, after admitting possession of a stun gun and CS spray at the start of the trial. He was found not guilty of possession of an offensive weapon.

The day after the killing, on November 14, 2016, Riddington had flown from Manchester airport to Dusseldorf, the court heard. A European Arrest Warrant was issued, but police discovered he had been living under the alias Barry Ryan for 10 years and found the stun gun and CS spray at addresses he had used.

When he was arrested in northern Cyprus following a local investigation he was found with a Namibian passport under the name Ricky de Bruin. He was deported to southern Cyprus and later returned to the UK.

Witnesses told police that Riddington and Mr Barker, whose partner had given birth to their daughter five days before his death, had previously trained together at the Double K gym.

On the day of the killing Riddington had been talking with the gym owner about a possible TV collaboration with Mr Redknapp. During the trial, Riddington said he spent the day before the stabbing at Mr Redknapp’s house, as they celebrated the Sky Sports pundit’s son’s birthday.

Joshua Boadu, 23, also known as SJ, was killed last year after a brutal stabbing.

He was attacked in broad daylight in Bermondsey, south London, on the evening of June 11.

Mr Boadu managed to flee from his assailants to a nearby home, where emergency services were called.

But the 23-year-old suffered a heart attack on the way to hospital and his life support was turned off 10 days later.

Denilson Davis, 21, and a 16-year-old boy - who cannot be named because of his age - will be sentenced next week.

Mr Boadu's family released a statement following the conviction. It read: ""Words cannot begin to describe how life has been since Josh's passing and he will be forever in our hearts.

“Words cannot describe the heartache and emotional anguish this senseless killing has caused and the impact on the family has been astronomical.

""Josh had his whole life ahead of him and he was full of so much untapped potential but his life was cut short due to a vicious and senseless murder.""

It went on: ""Things will never be the same for us and we have to live with this for the rest of our lives.

""Knowing Josh cannot celebrate another birthday or Christmas brings all the emotion back to us.

“Things that ‘could have been’ are amongst the hardest of things to forget and move forward when you lose a child, brother, uncle and friend like Josh.""

The killers drove to the site of the murder in a Peugeot with a third person who police are still hunting.

Witnesses described how Mr Boadu was ambushed by the trio and tried to defend himself before running away.

After the attack, the murderers fled in the car, and Davis and the boy later tried to call Mr Boadu on the phone.

Police later obtained footage of the killers in a ""celebratory mood"" in a Lewisham recording studio later the same evening.

Less than a week after the attack, police officers noticed the Peugeot and saw the driver running away.

Davis was arrested nearby, and his fingerprints - plus the DNA of the 16-year-old and Mr Boadu's blood - were all found in the car.

A hunting knife and a mobile phone were recovered from the car, and Davis admitted they belonged to him.

Det Insp Ian Titterrell said: “SJ was attacked in broad daylight on a Bermondsey estate, succumbing to his injuries several days later.

“We have never been able to establish a motive for this senseless killing.

""A thorough police investigation by my team, not to mention some great work from borough officers who proactively stopped two cars which yielded vital evidence, has led to today's convictions.

“While of course SJ's family remain devastated, I hope today's result brings them some comfort.""",Tim Baker,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/joshua-boadu-murder-family-shares-anguish-after-killers-convicted-following-bermondsey-stabbing-a4244461.html,2019-09-23 18:42:11+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Manuel Petrovic, 20, is one of four youths jointly accused over the death of the popular 17-year-old Girl Scout in Amy's Park in Harold Hill on March 1.

While on remand over the killing, Petrovic protested his innocence, saying he was only asked to drive to Harold Hill, and not told why.

During a covertly recorded prison visit by two female friends on May 24, he said: ""I'm going to say I'm a drug dealer, I broke the law with my driving and s***. I'm not into murder. I ain't going to go guilty for something I have not done. I'm no murderer.""

During a second visit on August 3, Petrovic allegedly said to a friend that Jodie was stabbed after his co-defendant Svenson Ong-a-Kwie was ""cheffed"".

According to a transcript of the conversation read out in court, Petrovic said: ""They went to bang out on their ops and banged out the wrong people.""

Asked how he knew that, Petrovic replied: ""Uh? Because I know that ... It was to do with Svenson's op - they cheffed him up a couple of month or something, a couple of months before.

""Someone give him the drop, he went to ride out and rid out on the wrong people in the park and they thought it was them because they chill in that area.

""That's why she got it from behind.""

Asked where the tip-off came from, Petrovic replied: ""They got their drop their self bruv. Because they were in a cab in Harold Hill when they text me saying 'ring me, ring me asap, need to come and see you asap'.""

During the conversations in prison, Petrovic also talked of his hope to ""bust the case"".

His friend told him he should ""take this opportunity"" if he got off the charge and take a ""nine to five job"".

Petrovic denies murder along with Ong-a-Kwie and two youths aged 16 and 17, from east London.

Jurors were told of an incident before Jodie's death in which Ong-a-Kwie was found with a makeshift bandage around his left thigh.

The defendant was said to have been vague about it, saying: ""Basically, this is what happened. They pulled up here in a car, jumped out and stabbed me in the leg.""

The court heard Petrovic had convictions dating back to 2013 including for possession of cannabis and handling stolen goods.

Ong-a-Kwie had pleaded guilty to possession of class A and B drugs when he was 16 years old.

He also had a conviction for the supply of cocaine and having stolen goods, jurors were told.

According to agreed facts read to court, the 17-year-old defendant, then aged 14, had been involved in an incident in a shop in which a member of staff was attacked with a screwdriver.

The youth went on to plead guilty to assault occasioning actual bodily harm and possessing a pointed article.

The trial was adjourned until Friday when the defence is due to start.

Lucy Chesney, 20, broke down in tears at the Old Bailey yesterday as Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, and a 17-year-old boy were found guilty of murdering her younger sister.

The pair had stabbed Jodie in the back as she sat with friends at Amy’s Park, Harold Hill.

Following the verdicts, Lucy said: “Jodie will be greatly missed and the people who caused such tragedy ... should hang their head in shame.”

She added: “You have ripped away a bright future that was destined to make a change to many lives.”

Jodie, an A-Level student and Girl Scout, died on March 1 shortly after being stabbed. Her boyfriend, who witnessed the murder, said he saw the taller man — said to be Ong-a-Kwie — reach upwards and then stab Jodie.

The killers fled, leaving Jodie’s friends to desperately call for help.

Both teenagers were drug dealers and detectives have suggested the stabbing may have been a botched attack on a rival drug operation, mistaking Jodie for another dealer.

Co-defendants Manuel Petrovic, 20, and a 16-year-old boy, were also accused of murder and were acquitted by the jury yesterday, after almost six hours of deliberations.

Drug dealer Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, from Romford ​has been jailed at the Old Bailey for life with a minimum term of 26 years.

While 17-year-old Arron Isaacs from Barking was locked up for at least 18 years for his part in Jodie’s murder.

Isaacs was previously not named however, the reporting restrictions have now been lifted by the court.

Both were sentenced today after being found guilty of murder at the Old Bailey on November 7.

In her sentencing, Judge Wendy Joseph QC told the court Jodie’s death, which led to a “world of anguish” for her family, came amid “tit for tat” incidents.

She said Jodie was the victim of “callous, casual and irresponsible violence” which had shocked the community “to the core”.

The defendants had gone to Amy’s Park for a “planned attack on a rival group” and mistook their target.

Judge Joseph told the court that Jodie was a “bright, warm and loving girl” who “should have led a happy and fulfilled life"".

“Above all those who loved Jodie will never get over her death,"" she said.

Addressing the defendants the judge added: “I’ve heard from them no word of true remorse and no true explanation.”

On the evidence, she found Ong-a-Kwie was the stabber and the 17-year-old his “enthusiastic supporter”.

The judge lamented the impact of criminals that had “carved up areas of the capital of this country”.

“The dangers this brings to decent law-abiding members of the public is graphically spelled out in this case,"" she added.

Judge Joseph said she ""entirely rejected"" the suggestion Jodie was mistaken for a rival drug dealer called Jade.

""The killing is far more sinister and dangerous than that,"" she added.

Jodie, 17, was attacked on the evening of March 1 as she sat with friends in Amy's Park in Harold Hill, east London.

The court heard how Ong-a-Kwie had convictions for possessing and supplying drugs.

He admitted being in breach of a six-week suspended sentence for handling stolen jewellery dating back to October last year.

The 17-year-old defendant had previous convictions for possessing a screwdriver, actual bodily harm, possession of cannabis as well as aggravated vehicle taking.

Two others, Manuel Petrovic, 20, and a 16-year-old, both from Romford, were cleared by the jury.

'This nightmare will never leave me'

During the hearing Crispin Aylett QC read out victim impact statements from a number of Jodie's family.

Jodie's nan Christine Chesney wrote: ""Since the evening of 1 March, my life has been turned upside down, and it will never be the same again. When I got the phone call to say what had happened to Jodie, I could not believe what I was hearing and it still feels like a dream. However, this nightmare is unfortunately real.

""Jodie was my youngest granddaughter, but she was more like a daughter to me. Since Jodie was very young, I helped her dad Peter in raising her and I would see her every day. Jodie would also ring me multiple times a day about anything and everything, so we were always in touch.

""Not seeing Jodie and hearing her voice on a daily basis has broken my heart. I struggle to sleep; I struggle to eat and my health has deteriorated. For the rest of my life, that night will not leave my mind. I will play that night over in my mind repeatedly, why didn’t Jodie come home that evening, why didn’t Jodie have an extra shift at work?

""I will feel guilt that she wasn’t with me that evening and I couldn’t do anything to help her.

""Jodie was murdered in March but this nightmare will never leave me. I will miss her every single day for the rest of my life and my life will never be the same again.""

Jodie’s father Peter Chesney told how he had just got a job in the City as a salesman when his life was “destroyed”.

From being ready to “take on the world” with a promising career, he was instead sitting in a cabin in his garden, writing a victim impact statement.

Mr Chesney said: “I have lost the most precious human being I will ever know. I have no idea how I’m going to continue my life or come to terms with the loss.

“I have a fantastic daughter Lucy and we are leaning on each other throughout this tragedy.”

boyfriend Eddy Coyle also had his victim impact statement read out on his behalf in which he called he ""funny"" and ""silly"".

He wrote: “I’ve never lost anyone before and for the first funeral I’ve gone to, to be my own girlfriend’s is incredibly hard. I loved her.”

Jodie’s sister Lucy Chesney added in a statement: “Losing her is like losing half of myself. We went through everything together and she was always there for me and always putting everyone before herself. She gave me a type of love I will never feel again.

Jodie’s cousin Kirsty revealed that the teenager’s nephew was born on the same day as the funeral. She said ""one of the happiest days of my life... was also one of the saddest.""

Jodie's father Peter Chesney said: “The murder of my beloved daughter has destroyed my life and the full extent as to how this has affected my family and me cannot possibly be explained simply in words.

“I have no idea how I am going to continue with my life or even come to terms with the loss.”

Her sister Lucy added in an impact statement: “I am only 20 and already I am dreading my life rather than looking forward to it.

“Jodie was not only my sister she was my best friend. Losing her is like losing half of myself. We went through everything together and she was always there for me and always putting everyone before herself.

“She gave me a type of love I will never feel again.""

Kirsty, Jodie’s cousin, said: “Jodie’s murder has affected my family and me in so many different ways. When she was killed, I was heavily pregnant with my son. This was meant to be a really happy time of my life but wasn’t.

“I ended up giving birth on the day of Jodie’s funeral, so I didn’t get chance to say goodbye. One of happiest days of my life, giving birth to my son, was also one of the saddest, as it was the day we had to say goodbye to Jodie.

“And every year on his birthday will be a reminder of another year since her funeral.

“How are any of us supposed to get over something like this? The answer is we never will but we just have to learn to deal with it. Jodie will never be forgotten.”

Speaking outside the Old Bailey following the sentencing hearing, detective chief inspector Dave Whellams, from the Metropolitan Police, said the force was ""pleased and proud of these convictions"".

He paid tribute to Jodie's family who he said had been through a ""great ordeal"" and expressed hope they would now be able to find ""some form of closure"".

She screamed and collapsed in the arms of her boyfriend, Eddie Coyle, 18, as her attackers made off in a fellow drug dealer's car.

Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, burnt his clothes and disposed of the knife he used to stab the Girl Scout immediately after the attack.

He had been lying low at the home of 17-year-old Arron Isaacs' uncle in Dagenham, east London, when police swooped to arrest them both on the evening of March 10.

When police arrived, they heard a commotion outside and an officer shouted: ""Around the back.""

In police body-worn video, Ong-a-Kwie can be seen clambering over a rear flat roof and crashing into the conservatory below.

An officer shouted: ""Stay where you are. Show me your hands now. Get over here now.""

As he was handcuffed, an officer confirmed to colleagues that he was ""detained"".

When told he was arrested on suspicion of murder, Ong-a-Kwie said: ""What? Murder? I killed no-one.""​

Meanwhile, Isaacs had escaped through a window but was apprehended in the back garden with a rucksack containing a deadly Rambo-style knife.

He was initially arrested on suspicion of assisting an offender but later also charged with Jodie's murder.

The footage was released by the Metropolitan Police as Ong-a-Kwie was jailed for at least 26 years and Isaacs was locked up for at least 18 years for their part in Jodie's death.​",Luke O'Reilly,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/dramatic-moment-police-swoop-on-east-london-house-and-arrest-jodie-chesneys-killers-a4290051.html,"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 17:49:00 GMT","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
190202,eveningstandard--2019-11-22--Grace Millane killer found guilty of murdering British backpacker in New Zealand,11/22/2019,eveningstandard,Grace Millane killer found guilty of murdering British backpacker in New Zealand,"A man has been found guilty of murdering British backpacker Grace Millane in New Zealand.

The killer stuffed her body in a suitcase, which was later found buried in bushland near Auckland.

The 27-year-old had claimed Ms Millane, from Wickford in Essex, died accidentally during ""rough sex"" after their Tinder date in December last year.

But jurors at Auckland's High Court on Friday found the defendant guilty of her murder following the two-week trial at Auckland High Court.

The decision, which came after about five hours of deliberation, was unanimous.

The killer stood emotionless, flanked by two corrections officers, as the verdict was read out.

He was remanded to custody until his sentencing on February 21.

Ms Millane's father, David Millane, and mother, Gillian Millane, wept after the verdict was delivered.

The couple have sat in the public gallery since the trial began on November 4, during which time they have been accompanied by Detective Scott Beard, who led the search for their daughter.

Mr Millane wept as he told reporters: ""The verdict of murder today will be welcomed by every member of the Millane family and friends of Grace.

""It will not reduce the pain and suffering we have had to endure over the past year.

""Grace was taken in the most brutal fashion a year ago and our lives have been ripped apart.

""Grace was our sunshine and she will be missed forever.""

After the date on December 1 last year, Ms Millane returned to the killer's hotel apartment and he strangled her to death either that night or in the early hours of the next morning - the date of her 22nd birthday.

The jury of seven women and five men returned a unanimous verdict after just five hours deliberation at Auckland High Court.

The Crown successfully argued the man, whose name is subject to a suppression order, strangled Ms Millane and shoved her body inside a suitcase before burying her in a forested area outside Auckland.

Ms Millane had been assumed missing and her father flew to New Zealand as local authorities spent a week searching until her body was found by police.

Justice Simon Moore told jury members before they delivered their verdict that they had to be certain the man had murderous intent when he put his hands on Ms Millane's neck during sexual intercourse to convict him of murder.

Mr Moore asked: ""Are you sure that when he applied pressure to Ms Millane's neck... Did he intend to cause injury?""

He further asked them to consider if the accused was willing to take the chance of Ms Millane dying due to his actions.

""If yes, then (the defendant) is guilty of murder,"" the judge said.

""In other words, (he) must have appreciated Ms Millane's death was a likely consequence... but was willing to run that risk.""

The killer had claimed the death was accidental and occurred during rough sexual intercourse.

His defence told the court Ms Millane had an interest in BDSM, with a previous sexual partner testifying they had used safe words and physical tapping to indicate when physical pressure became overwhelming.

During the trial, the jurors heard from forensic experts who examined the accused's apartment for blood stains as well as Ms Millane's body after her death.

They were also shown footage of the woman and the defendant drinking at various bars throughout Auckland and kissing before they returned to his apartment.

Video footage from the elevator of her exiting on the third floor marked the last recorded time Ms Millane was seen alive.

Police officers said phone data showed the killer had used Google to browse websites for large duffel bags, suitcases and car hire after Ms Millane died.

The defendant's phone was also used to search for ""flesh-eating birds"" and ""are there vultures in New Zealand?"".

Records showed the defendant had searched online for ""the hottest fire"", ""large bags near me"" and ""Waitakere Ranges"".

Ms Millane's killer faces life in prison with a minimum of 10 years without parole, though the judge can increase the latter period.​

Speaking after the guilty verdict was delivered, Ms Millane's father said: ""She did not deserve to be murdered in such a barbaric way during her gap year.""

He acknowledged the efforts of New Zealand's police, Det Insp Beard and thanked the prosecution team and the media.

""Finally we want to thank the people of New Zealand. I can't thank you enough for our your kindness and for opening your hearts to us,"" Mr Millane said.",Sean Morrison,https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/grace-millane-murder-trial-verdict-man-found-guilty-of-murdering-british-backpacker-while-on-tinder-a4293451.html,"Fri, 22 Nov 2019 09:47:00 GMT","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Khan, who was convicted of a terror offence in 2012, killed Jack Merritt, 25, and Saskia Jones, 23, during a conference on prisoner rehabilitation in Fishmongers’ Hall on Friday.

Khan, 28, had completed two rehabilitation schemes during the eight years he spent in prison and following his release.

The first, the Healthy Identity Intervention programme, was piloted from 2010. A study last year found it was “viewed positively” but the Ministry of Justice had not tested whether it prevents reoffending.

After his release last year, he took part in the Desistance and Disengagement scheme to help convicts “reintegrate safely” into society.

This was launched in 2016 and Government officials say neither programme has been operating long enough for their results to be assessed, the BBC reported.

A spokesman said: “All our offender behaviour programmes are monitored, evaluated and kept under constant review to ensure that they are effective in reducing reoffending and protecting the public.”

Khan injured three other people before being tackled by members of the public and shot dead by police.

193271,eveningstandard--2019-12-17--Prime suspect seized in hunt for killer of British tycoon Matthew Gibbard,12/17/2019,eveningstandard,Prime suspect seized in hunt for killer of British tycoon Matthew Gibbard,"The suspected killer of British millionaire businessman Matthew Gibbard in Argentina was arrested as he tried to leave the country, police in the country said today.

Mr Gibbard, 50, was shot in the chest after being followed from the airport to his five-star hotel in Buenos Aires by motorcycle gangsters who are thought to have targeted him for his expensive watch.

His stepson, Stefan Zone, 28, reportedly a product manager at JP Morgan in London, was shot in the leg and is in a stable condition in hospital.

Friends today told of their shock over Saturday’s attack. One told the Evening Standard: “It has just been traumatic. The family are devastated.”

Police apprehended the Venezuelan suspect, named locally as Angel Eduardo Lozano Azuaje, 21, in Salta, about 1,000 miles from the scene, on a coach bound for Bolivia.

Officers are understood to have been tipped off by his girlfriend during an interrogation.

He is the fifth person to be arrested over the robbery outside the £350-a-night Faena Arts Hotel. They include three Argentinians accused of supplying vehicles and the Venezuelan owner of a red Ford Fiesta which was said to have acted as a support vehicle.

Police said the gang would target wealthy holidaymakers wearing expensive watches at Ezeiza International Airport and follow their taxis to the city centre before carrying out robberies.

Chief of security for Buenos Aires, Marcelo D’Alessandro said: “This gang works in the arrivals hall of the airport, where they look for tourists coming from Europe and the United States. From there they begin their pursuit.”

He added: “They had a kind of placard, they would pretend to work for Uber.”

Mr Gibbard, from the village of Lowick, Northamptonshire, ran multimillion-pound holiday and retirement home firm Tingdene.

He is said to have been in Argentina for a Christmas break with his mother and wife Suzanne, 52, as well as Mr Zone and his stepson’s wife and brother. He was described by friends as a “softly spoken gentleman” who collected Ferraris and flew his own helicopter.","Gerard Couzens, BENEDICT MOORE-BRIDGER",https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/matthew-gibbard-shot-argentina-buenos-aires-a4315441.html,"Tue, 17 Dec 2019 10:02:00 GMT","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
326,21stcenturywire--2019-05-10--Julian Assange The UK Sweden and the Illusion of Justice,5/10/2019,21stcenturywire,"Julian Assange: The UK, Sweden and the ‘Illusion of Justice’","Whistleblower and political prisoner Chelsea Manning has been released from Alexandria Detention Centre in the US state of Virginia.  This follows the appeal made by her lawyers that continued detention would be a violation of law as it would be to punish her and not to ‘purge her contempt’ given her principled conviction in not cooperating.  She was held in contempt in March in relation to a grand jury investigation into the highly dubious, if not fabricated charges against WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange.  She is now facing the prospect of further detention as she has been subpoenaed to a different grand jury next week and by all accounts will continue refusing to cooperate.  At the same time Assange is fighting extradition from the UK to the US where it is likely he will face degrading treatment for the politically-driven charges against him.  The US and the UK, and Sweden in the case of Assange, have abused their legal systems to create a facade of  both ‘rule of law’ and ‘freedom through choice’, behind which Assange and Manning are persecuted.

As an army intelligence analyst,  Manning leaked documents to WikiLeaks which led to the exposure of horrific war crimes by the US,  including the  Collateral Murder cockpit video of the slaughter of unarmed civilians in Iraq in 2007.   For this Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison in 2010, commuted to 7 in 2017.  While outraged by Assange for his role in publishing leaks, the Trump government has also now gone after Manning.  Manning believes this to be about revenge, and the discrediting of truth-tellers and whistleblowers who dare hold governments to account, as she expressed in a statement just prior to release:

“I believe this grand jury seeks to undermine the integrity of public discourse with the aim of punishing those who expose any serious, ongoing, and systemic abuses of power by this government, as well as the rest of the international community. Therefore, participating in this fishing expedition – which potentially exposes other innocent people to the grand jury process – would constitute an unjustifiable and unethical action. Now, after sustaining serious psychological injury from my current confinement, I don’t wish to expose any other person to the trauma and exhaustion of civil contempt or other forms of prison or coercion.”

The personal toll this has taken on Manning is immense:

“Without committing a federal crime, and after exhaustive testimony at a trial several years ago, I am again ripped from my life by a vindictive and politically motivated investigation and prosecution.”

Manning faces continued detention because she won’t surrender.  Assange is probably still alive and fighting because he has not surrendered.  For Assange this meant that while in the Ecuadorian embassy he could only access urgent medical help by risking arrest and extradition to the US, which could have meant the death sentence or a life prison sentence.  Surrender or death.  Death or death.  The illusion of choice hid persecution.  Manning makes this very point:

The illusion Assange had a choice is also essential for the British government  to carry off that he was a criminal fugitive hiding from justice:

“…Assange is in the embassy of his own choice...”

 – Alan Duncan, Foreign Office

It is now evident that this was a lie.  Choice was an illusion for the public.  Assange would have risked the death sentence or life in prison by leaving the embassy.  This is what he could now face if extradited following his arrest on 11th April.  The British government lied.  What has now become apparent is that law is the government’s weapon of choice.

On 12th April, the day after Assange was arrested by the British police,  Labour MP Stella Creasey, with backing from over 70 MPs, wrote to the Home Secretary asking for Assange to be extradited to Sweden if its authorities re-opened the investigation into sexual allegations for which Sweden had requested Assange’s extradition in 2010.  This was based on no new claim of evidence, or due process, and could easily be seen as political interference to put pressure on the Swedish authorities.  The case itself has been condemned as trumped-up, a and violation of law.  Meanwhile, the Swedish authorities were not even  aware of the plan to arrest Assange:

“This is news to us too, and we haven’t yet processed the information…We don’t know why he has been arrested.”  – Sweden’s chief prosecutor, Ingrid Isgren

Creasey seemed to think this was about procedural oversight:

“The decision to rescind the political asylum of Mr Assange by the Ecuadorian authorities seems to have been something of which both the UK and US authorities were made aware in advance.”

How remiss of the UK government to forget the sexual allegations made by two Swedish women they seemed to care about for so many years.  Or perhaps the UK and US no longer needed the women:  extradition to the US could now be through the UK.  The sexual allegations, the initial vehicle for getting Assange to the US via Sweden, were presumably viewed as surplus to requirements on 11th April.  After years of hunting Assange on the pretext he was a ‘rapist evading justice,’ the U.K. government, like that of Sweden, a liberal champion of women’s rights, is exposed as fake,  exploiting sexual allegations for political agenda: in this case subservience to Washington’s attack on journalism and freedom of speech.

Millions were thrown at surveillance on Assange, a bounty the Crown Prosecution Service considered priceless, shown in a 2013 email to the Swedish prosecutor:

“I do not consider costs are a relevant factor in this matter.”

The statement made by  Women Against Rape in 2012 should help Creasey and Co. to understand why the British government did not notify the Swedes of Assange’s arrest but invested so much in these sexual allegations:

“Once again women’s fury and frustration at the prevalence of rape and other violence, is being used by politicians to advance their own purposes. The authorities care so little about violence against women that they manipulate rape allegations at will, usually to increase their powers, this time to facilitate Assange’s extradition or even rendition to the US.”

The illusion of ‘unavailability in the Ecuadorian embassy’

And now that Sweden has today announced it will decide next week whether to reopen the case for yet a third time, it is continuing its media circus tactics around Assange,  as previously pointed out by journalist John Pilger:

“For Assange, his only trial has been trial by media. On August 20, 2010, the Swedish police opened a “rape investigation” and immediately – and unlawfully – told the Stockholm tabloids that there was a warrant for Assange’s arrest for the “rape of two women”. This was the news that went round the world.”

Is the Swedish government creating a launching pad for reasserting itself as champion of women?  An opportunity for some face-saving for the calculated use of its prosecution services that took being dragged to the Swedish Supreme Court by Assange’s legal team before it would progress the preliminary investigation, while countless offers by both the Ecuadorian government and Assange’s lawyers for him to be interviewed were not taken up? As pointed out by former Foreign Secretary of Ecuador, Gillaume Long:

“There was no need for the Swedish authorities to delay for over 1,000 days before agreeing to carry out this interview, given that the Swedish authorities regularly question people in Britain and received permission to do so on more than 40 occasions in recent years.”

But should they decide to reopen the case, and have the case internationally scrutinised, an unlikely scenario according to Assange’s Swedish lawyer Per E Samuelson, it would mean all attention would then be on Sweden. This would remove it from the UK – convenient for the UK government to wash its hands of Assange and not be the betrayer of international law and of journalists and whistle blowers everywhere.  Sweden could take that title.

Creasey’s letter embodies the anti-human rights narrative that rejects the decision of the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention (UNWGAD) that Assange has been subjected to arbitrary detention. It is this anti-human rights narrative the British government is using to continue persecuting Assange by keeping him in stark prison conditions after years of confinement, while he now fights extradition.

To justify sentencing him to 12 months inside high-security Belmarsh prison for skipping bail seven years ago,  the court rejected his defense of asylum, despite the risk of persecution to Assange being more obvious than ever, vindicating his asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy.   We have an anti-human rights government in power and some courts are standing in line behind it giving away their independence and integrity to serve the war criminals hunting Assange.

MPs used the withdrawal of his Ecuadorian citizenship and asylum rights, an act recognised as unconstitutional and in violation of international law, as an opportunity to extradite Assange to Sweden from where he would be extradited to the US.  Once there he would face inhumane treatment, as warned by the UN rapporteur on torture.  This was a cowardly act by the MPs.  They have undermined asylum and human rights laws,  Creasey herself being a campaigner for asylum rights in Britain.   What’s more, they exploited the emotive progressive political and feminist outrage to ride rough shod over due process for Assange, while they stayed silent on the government’s use of sexual allegations for political gain, ‘a violation of law.’  Such are the “champions of action.”

The integrity of two individuals, publisher and whistleblower, has rocked the foundations of the most powerful who thought they were untouchable.  Their resilience against the uncivilised US beast and its supine servants puts to shame our liberal ‘progressive’ politicians who daren’t stray from mainstream narratives, no matter how corrupt or fake, through fear of disapproval.

“Whatever one might make of my principles and decisions, I shall continue to make hard choices and sacrifices rather than relinquish my ethical positions in exchange for mere trinkets of personal gain or self-pleasure in the form of being released.” – Chelsea Manning

MPs should demand an investigation into:

937,abcnews--2019-01-09--Former Guantanamo Bay commander indicted for obstructing justice in 2015 death,1/9/2019,abcnews,Former Guantanamo Bay commander indicted for obstructing justice in 2015 death,"The former commander of the Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay has been indicted on federal charges of obstruction of justice related to the January, 2015 death of a base employee who had confronted the officer with allegations that he was having an affair with his wife. Christopher Tur was found drowned in the waters of Guantanamo Bay two days after confronting Captain John Nettleton about the alleged affair.

Nettleton was arraigned Wednesday at the federal courthouse in Jacksonville, Florida exactly four years to the day that Tur disappeared following the confrontation and subsequent fight between the two men.

At the time, Nettleton was the commander of Naval Station Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Nettleton’s command did not include the detention facility at the base that is overseen by a one-star flag or general officer. Tur was a civilian employee of the commissary on the base.

According to the indictment, on the night of January 9, 2015 Tur confronted and yelled at Nettleton at a party at the Officers’ Club with allegations that the Naval officer had had an affair with his wife, Lara.

A short time later Tur went to Nettleton’s nearby residence and the two men engaged in a physical altercation that left Tur injured.

Investigators found texts from Nettleson's daughter, the only other person in the residence at the time, describing a loud commotion in the house. When she went to investigate she saw an unknown man hovering above her father, who was lying on the floor, attempting to use a cellphone.

The person that Tur phoned told investigators that Tur had told him he was ""at the Skipper's house"" and ""just knocked out the Skipper.""

Nettleson's daughter's texts described loud arguing and fighting that lasted for another half hour.

The next day Navy personnel went looking for Tur after he had not returned home.

Tur's body was found on January 11 floating in Guantanamo Bay after an intensive search at the base.

An autopsy determined he had drowned but had suffered fractured ribs and a laceration on his head.

From the moment the search for Nettlson began and throughout the subsequent investigation he did not mention to base personnel, investigators or his superior officer that Tur had last been seen at his home. He falsely claimed that he had last ween Tur at the Officers Club.

He also did not disclose that Tur had accused him of engaging in an affair with his wife, engaged in a physical fight at his home and that Tur had been injured.

Investigators later determined through DNA testing that blood stains found at Nettleson's home belonged to Tur. They also determined that Nettleson and Lara Tur had engaged in an affair in 2014.

Three weeks after Tur's disappearance Nettleson was relieved of command and placed in an administrative job in Jacksonville pending the results of a joint Naval Criminal Investigative Division and Justice Department investigation.

ABC News cited a U.S. official who said information had come to light during the investigation into Tur’s death that led the Navy to relieve Nettleton of command. The official said the investigation found that Nettleton had allegedly been having an affair with Tur’s wife Lara, the director of the Fleet and Family Services Center at the base.",Luis Martinez,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/guantanamo-bay-commander-indicted-obstructing-justice-2015-death/story?id=60268299,2019-01-09 23:34:46+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
71919,breitbart--2019-08-20--Warren Emphasizes LGBT Protections in Criminal Justice Reform Plan,8/20/2019,breitbart,Warren Emphasizes LGBT Protections in Criminal Justice Reform Plan,"She echoed many of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-VT) ideas, like ending cash bail, legalizing marijuana, eliminating private prisons, reducing the prisoner population, and implementing implicit bias training for officers. She also went squarely for Joe Biden’s (D) 1994 crime bill, calling for its repeal.

“The 1994 crime bill exacerbated incarceration rates in this country, punishing people more severely for even minor infractions, and limiting discretion in charging and sentencing in our judicial system,” she wrote, calling the “tough on crime” approach “wrong.”

“That punitive ‘tough on crime’ approach was wrong, it was a mistake, and it needs to be repealed,” she continued. “There are some sections of law, like those relating to domestic violence, that should be retained — but the bulk of the law must go.”

Unlike Sanders’ plan, however, Warren placed a significant emphasis on LGBT Americans, calling for the U.S. to “tackle” the problems within our criminal justice system by looking at the roots.

“That means implementing a set of bold, structural changes at all levels of government. And it starts by reimagining how we talk and think about public safety,” she wrote, using LGBTQ+ Americans as a key example:

“It should mean policies that recognize the humanity of trans people and other LGBTQ+ Americans and keep them safe from violence,” she wrote, later echoing Sanders’ call to “stop criminalizing homelessness,” which she says “disproportionately impact communities of color, LGBTQ+ people, and people with disabilities”:

Housing provides safety and stability, but too many experience homelessness. To make matters worse, many cities have criminalized homelessness by banning behavior associated with it, like sleeping in public or living in vehicles. These laws draw people into the justice system instead of giving them access to the services they need. They disproportionately impact communities of color, LGBTQ+ people, and people with disabilities, all of whom experience higher rates of homelessness. Rather than treating the homeless like criminals, we should get them with the resources they need to get back on their feet.

Warren also devoted an entire section to protecting “special populations,” including LGBTQ+ individuals.

“Vulnerable individuals like pregnant women, victims of domestic violence, people with disabilities, and LGBTQ+ individuals often require special protections while behind bars,” she wrote.

“I’ll implement a rigorous auditing program to ensure that prisons are adhering to legal requirements to protect LGBTQ+ individuals and others from sexual violence and assault while incarcerated, and prosecute prison staff who engage in misconduct,” she added.

Ultimately, Warren calls for more “preventative” approaches to criminal justice reform, with a heavy emphasis on “reforming police behavior” and “demilitarizing” law enforcement in order to gain public trust:

Militarizing our police contributes to mutual fear and distrust, and there is evidence to suggest it can actually make officers themselves less safe. As President, I will eliminate the transfer of military-grade weapons and lethal equipment to local police via the 1033 program, prohibit local law enforcement from buying military equipment with federal funding, and create a buy-back program for equipment already in use in our communities.

“Our system is the result of choices we’ve made—choices that together stack the deck against the poor and the disadvantaged,” Warren wrote in a tweet Tuesday.

 “We can create real law and order and real justice in our country by making long overdue big, structural change,” she added:",Hannah Bleau,http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/breitbart/~3/_i5NI_nvFsQ/,2019-08-20 15:16:36+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4387,activistpost--2019-04-04--Chill the Fk Out Good Cop Stops Fellow Cops as They Horrifically Beat 3 Innocent Men,4/4/2019,activistpost,‘Chill the F**k Out!’: Good Cop Stops Fellow Cops as They Horrifically Beat 3 Innocent Men,"Albany, NY — Utterly shocking body camera footage was released on Thursday showing what led to one officer’s arrest and felony assault charges and the suspension without pay of two others. What started over an alleged noise complaint quickly turned into a gang-style beat down of several innocent men.

On March 16, police were responding to a call over a loud party. When officers showed up, however, there was no loud party and all the lights inside the home were off. This wasn’t good enough for the cops, so one of them kicked the door into the home and ripped the occupant out onto the street and began beating him as he doused him in pepper spray.

For several moments, officers hold the man down as one of them kicks him repeatedly.

In total, three men were were all forced out into the street where they received this gang-style attack by uniformed assailants.

One of the most flagrant clips from the released footage shows officer Luke Deer shoving one of the men as he stood there with his hands in the air. Deer appears to snap and then jumps on top of the innocent man and starts savagely beating him.

As the footage shows, the man is not resisting and only trying to cover his face from the repeated blows being doled out by Deer. After his fists seemingly got tired, Deer then pulled out his baton and continued pummeling this innocent man.

The baton blows are so hard that the victim’s blood begins to splatter all over the concrete as he asks the raging cop why he is hitting him.

As another clip shows, two other officers—whose names have not been released—attack the other men and begin beating them.

The violence eventually becomes so unbearable that one cop felt it necessary to step in and stop it. As TFTP frequently points out, all too often police officers will do nothing as their fellow officers savagely beat innocent and often helpless and handcuffed individuals.

It appears in the video that these officers were going to do just that and beat these folks and get away with it. However, a good cop stepped in to stop it.

After Deer had his victim in handcuffs he jumps up in a fit of rage, seemingly ready to dish out more violence looking for anyone nearby that he can attack. At this point, we hear an officer yell at him to stop.

“Deer! Deer! Take a f*cking second! Chill the f*ck out, Deer!” the good cop says as he prevents the officer from hurting more innocent people.

Officer Deer appeared to be in a frenzy of rage ready to hurt anyone who was in front of him. Had this cop not stepped in to stop it, he may very well have beaten someone to death.

After the cops were done beating the innocent men, they arrested them all and brought false charges against them, all of which were dropped on Wednesday.

The first man who was seen getting pulled from the home was Lee Childs. He was charged with inciting a riot—for standing in his home with the lights out.

Armando Sanchez was the man with his hands up who was attacked by Deer. He was also charged with inciting a riot and resisting arrest.

Mario Gorostiza was also kidnapped and falsely charged. Had body camera footage of this incident not existed, all these bogus charges likely would have stuck as it was the word of these men against that of the uniformed officers. As for officer Deer, he has been arrested and charged with felony assault and official misconduct, a misdemeanor. He and his two fellow cronies who were also seen beating the innocent people have all been suspended without pay. “There are those in our community who believe that police always act responsibly and always tell the truth,” Alice Green of the Center for Law and Justice said Wednesday outside the courthouse, according to the Times Union. “Unfortunately, that’s not the case.” Below is one of the most egregious cases of police brutality TFTP has reported on in some time.

5035,activistpost--2019-07-23--Cops Mistakenly Raid Innocent Familys Home 3 TIMES in Just 4 Months,7/23/2019,activistpost,Cops Mistakenly Raid Innocent Family’s Home 3 TIMES in Just 4 Months,"Chicago, IL — Because of their gross negligence and incompetence, the city of Chicago is facing a slew of lawsuits for raiding the homes of innocent people — allegedly by mistake. TFTP has reported on several of these lawsuits in which cops raided a four-year-old’s birthday party and held other children at gunpoint. Now, however, we have learned that one of these families has been raided — mistakenly — three times in just the last four months.

“There was no time to breathe in between,” said Krystal Archie, 38, whose home in the 6800 block of South Dorchester Ave has been repeatedly raided by incompetent and often extremely rude cops. “I’d get my house together, and they were back in my house.”

Al Hofeld Jr., whose law office represents multiple families who’ve been wrongfully raided by incompetent Chicago police, held a press conference Friday to address the issue.

“There is a silent epidemic of trauma being perpetrated upon the children and families of the South and West sides of our city by Chicago police barreling into the wrong homes, holding guns on children, handcuffing children … ,” Hofeld said.

Hofeld has filed half a dozen lawsuits in recent months, claiming in each that children have been traumatized by gun-wielding cops bursting into homes during raids. Each time police came to Archie’s home — between February and May — they came in search of illegal drugs and someone who doesn’t live in her apartment, according to the suit, filed in U.S. District Court. A spokesman for the city’s Law Department said Friday said he he had not seen the lawsuit and so could not comment. Archie said it has cost her hundreds of dollars every time she’s had to clean up after the police have come through. She says she expects them to come again.

“We have to now look over our shoulders, and who we look for to protect us … we can’t see them in that light any more,” she said.

Archie explained to FOX 43 that not only were the officers who repeatedly raided her home unapologetic, but they also made fun of the family as they held Archie and her four children, aged 7-14, at gunpoint.

Archie told FOX 43 that the officers burst in, pointed guns at their heads and destroyed the furniture. They also said the officers made jokes while raiding the home.

Archie’s children now live in constant fear of armed terrorists barging into their home at any time. Sadly, however, they have no recourse, because these armed terrorists are police officers.

According to FOX 43, when Archie asked police why they kept raiding her home, she said one officer told her they needed to figure out what was going on with her neighbors. She said he implied CPD was targeting her apartment because she had a connection to her neighbors, which she said she did not.

Police now claim to be investigating these raids, but if history is any indicator, it will have little to no effect on innocent families being terrorized by Chicago’s finest.

“Chicago police officers behave as if our children of color and their trauma is collateral damage in Chicago,” said Holfield.

And he’s right. As TFTP reported earlier this year, when Samari Broswell, 7, was celebrating her younger brother, TJ Broswell’s 4th birthday earlier this year, she never expected to see 17 heavily armed cops come smashing through her door. However, thanks to a severe case of police incompetence, that is exactly what happened.

Now, just like Archie’s family, this family is left traumatized while people who claim to ‘protect’ them instead ignore them and continue the same practice. In the Broswell’s case, police claim video from officer-worn body cameras showing the horrifying raid simply went “missing.”

But that is not all.

On March 15, Alberta Wilson says Chicago police woke her up, along with her four children as cops forced their way into her home. It was below freezing outside with ice on the ground and despite this fact, the entire family was forced from the home and made to stand in the freezing rain.

Thinking he was a threat, the cops even handcuffed Wilson’s 8-year-old son Royal, who was also forced to stand in the freezing cold.

“They are afraid to go to the washroom, they are afraid to sleep by themselves, they are very nervous and jump,” Wilson said of her children after the raid.

Also, just last August, two little boys who used to look up to police were traumatized and their view of police tarnished after a SWAT team burst into their home at night and held the entire family at gunpoint, including the children. The family was innocent and just like the above cases, the raid was on the wrong home.",Activist Post,https://www.activistpost.com/2019/07/cops-mistakenly-raid-innocent-familys-home-3-times-in-just-4-months.html,2019-07-23 17:32:12+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5377,activistpost--2019-08-24--Houston Cop Who Lied About Raid that Killed Innocent CoupleCharged with Murder,8/24/2019,activistpost,Houston Cop Who Lied About Raid that Killed Innocent Couple—Charged with Murder,"Houston, TX — The murder of an innocent Houston couple made national headlines earlier this year as police took to smearing their names and threatening those who didn’t believe their official narrative. As the months passed, we learned that the Houston police department’s raid on the home of Dennis Tuttle and Rhogena Nicholas was based on lies and they were murdered for no reason. In May, the case had reached a turning point after the family hired a forensics expert to examine the home and found that there is no evidence the officers encountered gunfire. And, moments ago, the cop who lied to attain the warrant for the raid—was charged with murder in the first degree.

Ex-case agent Gerald Goines on Friday was hit with two counts of felony murder and is still under investigation over claims he stole guns, drugs and money, Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg announced at a news conference downtown. His partner, Steven Bryant, was also charged with one count of witness tampering. Both men are expected to turn themselves in by the end of the day, but prosecutors said a review of more than 14,000 cases and a broader investigation into the rest of the squad is still underway.

“We have not seen a case like this in Houston,” Ogg said. “I have not seen a case like this in my 30-plus years of practicing law.”

“Based on everything we’ve seen so far, that’s certainly something that should happen,” Mike Doyle, an attorney representing family members said, “but it really can’t be the ending point based on what we’ve uncovered so far.”

As we reported in March, these lying cops could be responsible for putting away hundreds of innocent people. Houston District Attorney Kim Ogg previously announced that 1,400 cases tied to Officer Goines are in question. And now, her office estimates that at least 800 more cases could be tainted which are tied to Bryant.

It is important to point out that the only likely reason these officers have been charged is because outside sources in the family stepped up and not only demanded answers but found them.

According to the forensics experts hired by the family of the victims, the officers who suffered bullet wounds during the raid on the innocent couple’s home were shot by their fellow cops. This is a direct challenge to the official narrative which states the officers were forced to kill the couple after the couple opened fire on them.

It is important to point out that even if the couple did open fire on the officers, the officers were in plainclothes when they kicked in the door to the home and fired first and killed their dog. However, this appears to never have happened.

According to police, when they kicked in the door to the home they were forced to shoot the couple’s dog, at which point Tuttle grabbed his .357 Magnum revolver and opened fire on the officers. Then, according to police, Nicholas moved in to disarm one of the officers, so they shot and killed her. However, according to the forensics experts, there is no evidence of this.

Furthermore, the forensics team noted that police never really investigated the crime scene and left behind mountains of evidence showing what really transpired.

“It doesn’t appear that they took the basic steps to confirm and collect the physical evidence to know whether police were telling the truth,” said attorney Mike Doyle. “That’s the whole point of forensic scene documentation. That’s the basic check on people just making stuff up.”

The independent forensic investigation was conducted over the course of four days by forensic expert Mike Maloney, a retired supervisory special agent with the Naval Criminal Investigative Service.

His findings were nothing short of bombshell and imply that the Houston police department is engaged in a massive cover-up.

As the Houston Chronicle reported, “though police said they started shooting when the dog lunged as they came through the door, Maloney’s forensics team found that the dog was shot and killed at the edge of the dining room, 15 feet from the front door. Authorities never picked up the shotgun shell when they collected evidence.”

What’s more, the forensics team found no evidence that bullets were fired from the back of the house, where police claim Tuttle opened fire on them, toward the front door, where police claim they were shot.

“The initial bullet trajectories appear to be somewhat contradictory,” said Louisiana-based attorney Chuck Bourque, who is also representing the Nicholas family. “We see no evidence that anybody inside the house was firing toward the door.”

The bullet holes through the front of the house, that police claim came from the inside, were actually fired from outside the home at least a foot away, into the house, according to the forensics team.

“You can’t see into the house from there,” Bourque said, “you’re firing into the house through a wall.”

Randomly firing through a wall into a house where your fellow cops are standing is a good way to shoot your fellow cops. While the forensics team didn’t speculate, the evidence points to a story that unfolded far differently than what police are saying. And now, police are acting on the actual story.

It appears that when police kicked in the door and began shooting, the officers outside the home began firing into the home, shooting both cops and the innocent couple in the process. Thinking they were under fire from the couple, the other cops then shot and killed Tuttle and Nicholas. Even more damning is the fact that the forensics team found no evidence Tuttle’s .357 was ever fired in the home and the only bullets pulled from the walls were .223 and .45 caliber—which came from police. The forensics team also noted that the amount of evidence left behind by police was overwhelming, which means there was no way they could’ve actually conducted a thorough enough investigation to determine if the officers were telling the truth. “I can’t explain why all that was left — that sounds like something only the Houston Police Department and investigators can answer,” said former Houston Police Chief Charles A. McClelland. “If that evidence is connected to that shooting scene, I’d certainly be asking questions.” Sam Walker, a criminal justice professor at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, called it “sloppy” and said the uncollected evidence raises other questions, according to the Chronicle. “How many people have been convicted over the years as a result of sloppy investigations which failed to collect evidence that was there that would have exonerated the suspect?” he asked. “If they do it in this kind of a homicide case, what do they do in other kinds of investigations?” Matt Agorist is an honorably discharged veteran of the USMC and former intelligence operator directly tasked by the NSA.

5676,activistpost--2019-09-23--Watch as Cops Record Themselves Making Up Fake Charges to Kidnap Innocent Man Steal His Car,9/23/2019,activistpost,"Watch as Cops Record Themselves Making Up Fake Charges to Kidnap Innocent Man, Steal His Car","Jasper, GA — If you still have any doubt that police are here just for your protection, the following video should be enough to convince you otherwise. An entirely innocent man, Charles A. Spradlin had committed no crime, had harmed no one, and was on his own property when two Georgia State Troopers illegally stopped him, kidnapped him, and stole his vehicle. The gross violation of rights was captured on video as the two troopers discussed the various ways to accomplish their illegal goals. The trooper’s conduct is now the subject of a federal lawsuit.

This infuriatingly corrupt incident unfolded on March 26, 2016 when Spradlin got a call from his neighbor — whose son happened to be killed by police — letting him know that officers had set up a checkpoint near his home. According to the lawsuit, Spradlin then got in his car, drove to the end of his driveway and parked on a hill to see where the checkpoint was. When he didn’t see it, he turned around and drove back to his home.

Spradlin would never make it back to his house, however, because Georgia State Trooper TFC Jonathan Salcedo pulled him over, kidnapped him and stole his car.

As the video shows, Salcedo admits that he pulled over Spradlin because he saw him turn around. It is not illegal to turn around. And, according to the lawsuit, Spradlin turned into an adjacent driveway, used his turn signal and obeyed all traffic laws. But this was irrelevant to this tyrant.

Salcedo immediately began to berate Spradlin, accusing him of violating a law that the trooper had just made up: turning around before a checkpoint. Spradlin told the trooper why he drove to the end of his driveway — to get a view of the police checkpoint — but the trooper couldn’t have cared less. He was going to make sure he turned this man’s day into a living hell.

As the video shows, Spradlin confirmed to the trooper that he had a driver’s license and asked for the basis of Officer Salcedo’s stop. According to the lawsuit, officer Salcedo became visibly agitated and told Spradlin to turn around and put his hands behind his back.” Spradlin was then handcuffed and locked in the backseat of the cruiser.

The officers then proceeded to illegally search the man’s vehicle. It wasn’t the search that was most infuriating, however. It was the troopers discussing what they could charge this innocent man with.

“Looks like his tires are worn, that’s our P.C. (probable cause) right there,” one trooper says. Worn tires are not probable cause for a stop and even if it was, this trooper had no way of seeing worn tires while the vehicle was in motion.

The officers then call their supervisor and ask him for permission to continue to violate this man’s rights. As the video shows, they were clueless of the law and were scrambling for a reason to kidnap this man.

“Let’s check his window tint,” the cop said, continuing to fish for something to find on Spradlin. The cops then illegally proceeded to search Spradlin’s vehicle, without his consent and against their supervisor’s orders. When asked by Spradlin why they were searching his vehicle, they claimed it was an “inventory” and not a “search.”

As the officers continue their illegal detainment, they turn off their recording devices in what was was likely an illegal conversation to figure out how to kidnap an innocent man and steal his car. When the mics turn back on, Spradlin is told his vehicle is being impounded and he is being arrested.

Police then stole Spradlin’s car and kidnapped him, falsely charging him with failure to display license, obstruction of justice, and having unsafe tires. It took two days for Spradlin to get his car back after he had to make bail and pay a $200 impound fee.

Three weeks later, according to the lawsuit, during a preliminary hearing on April 14, 2016, a judge dismissed the obstruction of justice charge because there was “not in fact evidence to sustain that a reasonable person would believe that a crime was committed.” He also dismissed the unsafe tire charge because there was “never any testimony that [the tires] were below 2/32 of an inch.” The prosecution later dropped the failure to display license charge.

Spradlin is now suing Salcedo for violations of his Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Amendment rights and he will likely win as the judge has already dismissed Salcedo’s claim for immunity.",Activist Post,https://www.activistpost.com/2019/09/watch-as-cops-record-themselves-making-up-fake-charges-to-kidnap-innocent-man-steal-his-car.html,2019-09-23 00:04:54+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5983,"activistpost--2019-11-14--Innocent Mom Speaks Out After She Was Kidnapped, Interrogated for Speaking Spanish",11/14/2019,activistpost,"Innocent Mom Speaks Out After She Was Kidnapped, Interrogated for Speaking Spanish","Havre, MT — Ana Suda and Martha “Mimi” Hernandez are both U.S.-born citizens who grew up in Texas and California respectively. But their lifelong citizenship and complete lack of criminal record would have no bearing on a US Border patrol agent hell-bent on taking ‘dangerous’ Spanish speaking women off the streets of Havre, Montana. Since that fateful day on which these women were detained for speaking Spanish, Suda says her life has become a nightmare.

As TFTP reported at the time, the incident happened on May 18, 2018, as Suda and Hernandez stood in line at a local grocery store. The two ladies were having a friendly conversation—in Spanish—an entirely legal and common activity which takes place in most grocery stores everyday in this country. However, the Border Patrol Agent in line behind them, saw their conversation as nefarious. He just knew they were evil criminal scum.

As the two innocent US citizens checked out at the register, this “hero” public servant demanded to know where they were born. Remember, they had done nothing wrong and were simply speaking Spanish. Still, Suda and Hernandez complied and told the officer they were born in Texas and California. But he did not believe them.

The agent then demanded the two women hand over their driver’s licenses which were apparently not enough to get them immediately on their way. The two innocent US citizens were then held against their will—otherwise known as kidnapping—by US Border Patrol Agents who completely humiliated them in front of their friends and neighbors.

“After Mimi and I told the officer that we were born in the U.S.,” Suda explained. “he demanded that we show identification. I didn’t feel like I could say no since he was in uniform and armed. We gave him our Montana driver’s licenses and then followed him outside into the store’s parking lot as directed. ”

During their illegal detainment, Suda and Hernandez were interrogated as if they were criminals. The scene is something akin to the era of “papers please” as these entirely innocent women were temporarily kidnapped and forced to prove they weren’t “illegal” human beings who should be shipped off to some ‘camp’.

Had they been “illegal,” the stop was still unconstitutional, as speaking Spanish is most assuredly not probable cause for detainment. Even if a person speaks no English at all, the state cannot detain them for it.

Nevertheless, this tyrant agent had no problem telling the women why he had taken them into custody. When Suda and Hernandez asked him why they were being humiliated and interrogated, the officer responded with brutal honesty.

Suda explained that, “Agent O’Neal — the name on his badge — got on his car radio and asked for backup, as if two moms holding a carton of eggs were a threat. As we stood there, I felt a knot in the pit of my stomach. I told him that I was going to start filming on my cell phone. Then I made a simple request, ‘Can you tell us in video why you asked for our ID’s please.’”

“He said it was because, ‘You guys are speaking Spanish which is very unheard of up here,’” said Suda.

For nearly an hour, Suda and Hernandez were held captive as other armed agents showed up in their uniforms and carrying guns—to investigate two American soccer moms—a shameful act indeed.

Now, Suda is speaking out. In an interview with BBC, Suda says she and her family have faced constant harassment over the video of her rights-violating incident. She was forced to move and her family is now separated.

Suda and Hernandez’ case is now the subject of an ACLU lawsuit as their detention was unlawful, unconstitutional, and entirely uncalled for.

Sadly, Hernandez says that her family has also been harassed repeatedly and have received hateful messages from people across the country.

Their children are even feeling the effects of this disgusting madness.

“At his high school, a teacher asked Mimi’s son whether he had brought his ID to class. My 8-year-old daughter is scared to speak Spanish and has started responding to me in English when I ask her questions,” said Suda.

Below is the infuriating and saddening video from last year.

6253,"activistpost--2019-12-13--“Drug Recognition Experts” Arresting Innocent, Sober People for DUI at Alarming Rate All Based on a ",12/13/2019,activistpost,"“Drug Recognition Experts” Arresting Innocent, Sober People for DUI at Alarming Rate All Based on a Hunch","As TFTP has reported on numerous occasions, motorists in police state USA are snagging DUI charges for being stone-cold sober. Roadside extortionists with badges calling themselves “experts” are the main culprits, according to several sources. Now, it seems, mainstream news media outlets are catching up on the sanctioned extortion and bravely reporting on the phenomena.

According to ABC 15 Arizona, stone-cold sober drivers in Phoenix, AZ are getting DUIs and have to spend thousands of dollars proving their innocence. It seems the source of the misunderstandings and illegitimate arrests, once again, come from Drug Recognition Experts (DRE), cops with badges and fancy titles who claim they can look at a motorist and on observation alone determine if someone is impaired.

You’d have to be God to know if someone is under the influence by simply looking at them. With that being the issue, worse still is the fact the DRE’s testimony often holds up in court without so much as a failed breathalyzer or a dirty toxicology report showing alcohol and drugs in someone’s system.

One Phoenix cop in particular, Officer David Morris, has made 56 DUI arrests since April 2018. In a state which annually doles out over 21,000 DUIs per year, Morris’ numbers are not all that astounding. It’s just that several of his alleged perpetrators whom he arrested for DUI were absolutely, completely, 100 percent, sober.

Tasha McConnell said her DUI was traumatizing. She said she was pulled over for failing to come to a complete stop at a stop sign but that Morris wanted to dig into her drug history immediately asking her what drugs she was taking, prescription or otherwise. He told her that “eye tremors” were giving her away and his supposed DRE experience made an expert at determining impairment. McConnell told the press:

Mike Toth also got arrested and charged for DUI after revealing to Morris he was taking antacids for his acid reflux. The officers involved in his arrest allegedly told him even acid pills could impair his judgement. Seriously. Originally pulled over for failing to maintain his lane, Toth described what happened next.

Incredulously, Phoenix PD and its leaders fail to see a problem in their officers’ actions in depriving people of their freedom, humiliating them, forcing them to lose sleep, and fight for their good name. No, the chain of command seems more content with business as usual than ensuring the public is fairly protected against unlawful arrests, searches, and seizures. Phoenix PD Detective Kemp Layden defended his DRE officers’ actions saying, in effect, even though the motorists’ blood tests were clean, there’s still doubt as to whether or not they’re impaired. Layden said:

Kemp and his so-called “experts” (phony experts according to many police accountability activists) quite possibly may be the latest iteration in policing for profit. Here’s the possible scam. Get enough cops certified as “experts” at detecting drugs and the system can be flooded with many more DUI cases, fattening the wallets of DUI lawyers, filling the prosecutors’ dockets, enriching the court by way of court fees, and getting the crooked judges who go along with it to easily get reelected for being “tough on crime”. Yeah right! It’s the antithesis of being tough on crime. It’s actually condoning highway robbery!

Let’s face it. Experts are developed, not rubber stamped. They’re learned, educated people who can lecture on a topic without referring to their notes. What they are not are high-school graduate cops who can sniff out drugs better than a drug dog by filling out a checklist and declaring someone to be under the influence. It’s one of the scariest scams we’re aware of, and we’ve reported on it many times before in states all across the union.

Our readers may remember a Buckeye, AZ cop who was also a DRE. He believed a child with Autism was under the influence of drugs while he was stimming, fidgeting with his string. It’s what some autistic kids do to de-stress. Officer David Grossman threw the boy down to the ground, injuring him to the point of surgery, and costing the taxpayers $5 million dollars when they sued. Yeah…that kind of expert…the kind who cannot tell an autistic kid from a meth head.

We interviewed a mid-30s Colorado man who got a DUI in Phoenix while as sober as the day is long. He stated he got a DUI one evening while serving as the designated driver for his friend squad. Unfortunately for David (not his real name for fear of retaliation), a Phoenix police officer pulled him over, gave him a field sobriety test, which he failed, and cited him for DUI.

David says he failed the roadside tests because he has a debilitating physical condition called vertigo and he simply has difficulty balancing on his feet. David claims his ailment in no way affects his driving. He says he blew .000 on the breathalyzer, and even with a clean toxicology report, the DUI stuck.

That’s right America. The cops who are sworn to protect and serve your constitutional rights are the same ones who can lie and say you’re impaired without any proof, and it will stand up in a court of law. That’s precisely why we need police activists and accountability advocates. The DRE scam is one such example of how cops are getting away with expert extortion and there’s not a damn thing anyone can do about it.

6327,"activistpost--2019-12-20--Watch as Cops Frame Innocent Brothers for Cocaine, Try to Destroy Video — But it Survived",12/20/2019,activistpost,"Watch as Cops Frame Innocent Brothers for Cocaine, Try to Destroy Video — But it Survived","New York, NY — To all those who make the bogus claim of “if you don’t do anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about,” consider the following case as even more evidence of how ridiculous that assertion is. Two innocent brothers were framed by NYPD cops who were caught on video destroying video evidence of their egregious act. Luckily for the brothers, the hard drive in the video recorder survived and it caught these badged criminals in the act.

Earlier this year, apparent criminals with the NYPD’s gang unit executed a search warrant on a store owned by two brothers. The entrepreneurs had committed no crime, were conducting 100% legal business, yet they were kidnapped by officers and caged for over a month on false charges.

The cops accused the brothers of having a large amount of cocaine and when they were booked into jail, the DA’s office provided no documentation and asked for the two brothers to be held without bail.

“It was the worst day of my life,” said one of the brothers, who asked not to be identified by name, according to NBC 4. “We never had drugs in the store,” he added.

Highlighting the level of criminality associated with this raid is the fact that the cops used the notoriously faulty field test kits to test the “cocaine.” As TFTP has reported on numerous occasions, tens of thousands have been convicted and served time for crimes they didn’t commit because the cases against them relied on horribly unreliable field drug test kits. So prone to errors are the tests, courts won’t allow their submission as evidence. However, they are continued to be used by law enforcement, needlessly ruining thousands of lives.

This time, however, the test kits showed that the substance tested was not drugs. Yes, you read that correctly. The cheap faulty kit actually returned a negative result for cocaine, but the cops arrested the innocent brothers anyway and had them locked up without bail.

The brothers would spend over a month in jail before lab tests for cocaine came back negative. All the charges were then dropped, but their lives and business had been ruined by their absence. When the brothers finally went back to their store, they found that cops had left behind the field test kits — which all showed negative results. That wasn’t the only thing cops left behind either. As NBC New York reports:

Attorney Marvyn Kornberg, a criminal attorney who represents the brothers, said, “It’s a unit gone wild, that’s what it says to me. They think they’re above the law. They’re ripping out cameras. What are they afraid of the public seeing?”

Naturally, the NYPD, who claims this incident is “under investigation,” said they destroyed the cameras for “tactical” reasons.

“That’s ridiculous,” said Richard Rivera, a former police officer in West New York, New Jersey, who is now a police tactics expert, according to NBC 4.

“They could have covered the cameras. The way they come in doesn’t indicate that any of them is concerned about a remote feed. They’re not worried about security. It’s like a walk in the park to them,” he said, noting that there is no legitimate reason to destroy evidence in that manner.

“This whole incident is a huge mess for them,” he said. “If this is an ongoing drug case, they would want to preserve the evidence, not destroy it, and that’s exactly what they did.”

When asked why they would recommend no bail for the brothers, the DA’s officer pointed the finger back at the NYPD, saying they relied on their word that the claims were true. Unfortunately for the brothers, this blind trust in badged criminals would land them in a cage for over a month.

To date, the brothers still have no idea why these criminals from the NYPD showed up at their store that day. As part of their lawsuit against the city, they have demanded prosecutors turn over the underlying basis for the search warrant. They have also filed a notice of claim to sue the city and the taxpayers will undoubtedly be held liable for these criminal cops.

Lee Carroll said the wrangle with bureaucrats was the worst experience of his life.

The 36-year-old, who lives on Merseyside with his ten-year-old daughter, said he was left feeling ""like a criminal"" as his claims of innocence fell on deaf ears.

He even held his phone up so the civil servants he was dealing with could hear the noise of everyday life in a bid to prove he was not in the Winson Green jail.

Lee, who works in a Novotel in Liverpool, said: “I have never been in prison, on bail, or wanted by police.

“I was made to feel like I had done something wrong, like I was a criminal. I even said to them how can I be ringing you now on my mobile from prison, when prisoners don’t have mobiles?

“And I put the phone up so they could hear noise in the background of traffic and music, while I was walking through town.’”

Lee told the Liverpool Echo he went to police for help, wrote to his MP and contacted Action Fraud. He added: “I told the DWP my employer had said she would send in a letter and told them to check my earnings.

“I said I could fax them over, but they just left me with no money.”

He contacted the Department for Work and Pensions after he noticed his monthly payment had been suspended.

But an advisor told him he would not be receiving the money because “he was in prison in Birmingham”.

It is believed the error was caused because another man with the same name and date of birth as Lee was on the system.

Now the DWP has apologised and said the mistake was caused by an “administrative error”.

Lee, who was due a £751 payment in January, said: “It is the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my whole life.

“I knew I was going to get the payment on a certain date so you sort of budget for that date.

“All my last wage in December went on Christmas and council tax. I don’t have family I can turn to for help.

“I am one of those people that is going out to work to save them money and then they do this. I get up and go to work and still take my daughter to school. It is just shocking what they have done.”

A spokeswoman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: “ We have apologised to Mr Carroll for this administrative error and reinstated his benefit payments immediately.”",James Cartledge,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/innocent-dad-universal-credit-stopped-15645081,2019-01-13 05:30:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
58479,birminghammail--2019-03-18--Disgraced MP Fiona Onasanya declares shes innocent in first video since release from jail,3/18/2019,birminghammail,Disgraced MP Fiona Onasanya declares she's 'innocent' in first video since release from jail,"Disgraced MP Fiona Onasanya has vowed to continue as a ""voice of change in Parliament"" in her first video to be published since she was released from prison.

In the clip, posted on her social media channels the day before the start of a petition that could unseat her, she claims that she is innocent of perverting the course of justice.

The Peterborough MP was found guilty by a jury at the Old Bailey and was sentenced to three months in prison.

The 35-year-old, who was elected as a Labour MP, served just 28 days for lying about who was driving her car when it was caught speeding in July 2017.

She was released on February 26.

Ms Onasanya, a solicitor, still received her £77,379 salary while in jail despite missing votes in the Commons.

In the video, posted on Monday, she says: ""I am telling you I am innocent and will continue to pursue avenues to clear my name.

""If you wish for me to continue as your independent Member of Parliament I am willing and able to do so but the choice is now in your hands.

""I would like to say I have a deep gratitude to all who have offered prayers, support and love during this difficult period of time over the past few months and also say to you all, thank you.

""I will continue to be your voice of change in Parliament for as long as you wish me to do so and if you do wish me to do so I can tell you I will continue to lobby Government, I will continue to fight for social justice with all of the veracity and power that I have been so far, and continue to be your voice, because you deserve nothing less.""

Jurors at the Old Bailey were told that she colluded with her brother Festus after her car was clocked speeding at 41mph in a 30mph zone in the village of Thorney, near Peterborough, in July 2017.

She was sent a notice of intended prosecution (NIP) to fill out, but it was sent back naming the guilty driver as Aleks Antipow, an acquaintance of her brother, who was away visiting his parents in Russia.

Festus Onasanya, 34, from Cambridge, was jailed for 10 months after he admitted three counts of perverting the course of justice over speeding, including the July 24 incident.

Ms Onasanya claims in the video, posted on Monday, that her defence ""was never put across in the media"".

Giving evidence at her trial, Ms Onasanya said that when she received the notice of intended prosecution (NIP) she left it at her mother's house for whoever had borrowed her car to complete, assuming she had been in London.

She said that while being pursued over the NIP she suffered a relapse of multiple sclerosis and was admitted to hospital for three days, and said that when she asked her brother about the ticket he told her it was all ""sorted"".

Ms Onasanya appealed against her conviction, but this was thrown out at the Royal Courts of Justice.

A recall petition will be opened on Tuesday and voters will have six weeks to sign before it closes at 5pm on May 1.

If it attracts the signatures of 10% of eligible voters, about 7,000 people, Ms Onasanya will be forced out and a by-election called.

Under recall rules, Ms Onasanya will be permitted to stand for re-election.",James Rodger,https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/disgraced-mp-fiona-onasanya-declares-15992458,2019-03-18 14:36:27+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“The behavior of the defendant will not be tolerated and the Department of Justice will seek to prosecute those who abuse their power,” said Assistant Attorney General Eric Dreiband for the Civil Rights Division. “We commend the officers who came forward and brought about the opening of the investigation. We also thank our law enforcement partners who assisted in this case.”

“Law enforcement officers receive certain powers from the government so they can protect the rights of the citizens they serve,” said FBI Minneapolis Special Agent in Charge, Jill Sanborn. “When an individual officer’s actions violate that trust, he or she should be held accountable which the jury confirmed with today’s verdict. We thank all those who assisted on this case,” Sanborn added.

The evidence presented at trial established that the Defendant and other officers responded to a 911 call alleging that an unidentified black male with dreadlocks and a white t-shirt had been involved in a street fight and was carrying a gun. Upon their arrival on scene, officers found no evidence of any street fight, but they noticed one man who matched that general description, sitting in his car talking on a cellphone. One of the responding officers, along with his police K-9, approached the man’s car and, without identifying himself as a police officer, yelled at the man to get out. The man, later identified as Frank Baker, got out of the car, as the officer yelled commands and the police K-9 barked loudly at him. Seven seconds later, the officer released the K-9, which took Mr. Baker to the ground and began mauling his leg. While Baker was on the ground, screaming in pain, the Defendant arrived and kicked Baker three times in the ribs. The defendant’s kicks broke seven of Baker’s ribs and caused both of his lungs to collapse, putting him in critical condition. Officers found no gun at the scene and no evidence that Baker, a 52-year-old grandfather who lived in the neighborhood, had been involved in any fight.

Two of the officers who witnessed the defendant’s actions that night, Officers Joseph Dick and Anthony Spencer, reported the Defendant to their supervisor. Dick and Spencer both testified for the government at trial, about the defendant’s use of force and about harassment and retaliation they suffered after stepping forward to report a fellow officer. Dick, Spencer, and a third officer from the scene told the jury that they saw no legitimate reason for the defendant’s kicks. Additionally, officers testified that the defendant boasted afterward about having kicked Baker.

Following more than two weeks of trial, the jury in the U.S. District Court in St. Paul, MN, deliberated for 11 hours before finding the Defendant guilty of using excessive force.

The Defendant faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison. A sentencing hearing will be scheduled after the completion of a presentence investigation by the United States Probation Office.",----,https://breaking911.com/cop-convicted-of-excessive-force-after-man-was-kicked-into-critical-condition-while-being-bit-by-k9/,"Wed, 27 Nov 2019 03:24:05 +0000","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rodney Reed's Family Demands Retrial Amid New Evidence,"This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.

AMY GOODMAN: The state of Texas is facing growing calls to halt the execution of Rodney Reed, an African-American man who spent over 20 years in prison for a rape and murder he says he did not commit. A group of 26 Texas lawmakers, including both Democrats and Republicans, penned a letter this week asking Governor Greg Abbott to stop the execution planned for November 20th. More than a 1.4 million people have signed an online petition to save Reed’s life. Supporters include celebrities Kim Kardashian West, Rihanna and Meek Mill.

Rodney Reed was sentenced to die after being convicted by an all-white jury for the 1996 murder of Stacey Stites, a 19-year-old white woman. The two were having an affair at the time. But substantial evidence has since emerged implicating Stites’ fiancé, a white police officer named Jimmy Fennell, who was later jailed on kidnapping and rape charges in another case. In a major development, a man who spent time in jail with Fennell signed an affidavit last month asserting that Fennell had admitted in prison he killed his fiancée because she was having an affair with a black man.

Later in the show, we’ll be joined by Rodney Reed’s brother and sister-in-law. But first, let’s turn to the documentary A Plea for Justice, made by Filmmakers for Justice.

AMY GOODMAN: An excerpt from A Plea for Justice about the Rodney Reed case. Last month, the popular daytime TV host Dr. Phil aired an interview he did with Rodney Reed on death row.

AMY GOODMAN: Rodney Reed, speaking on the Dr. Phil show ahead of his execution scheduled for November 20th.

Well, I recently sat down with Rodney Reed’s brother and sister-in-law, who we’ll hear from later in the show. They recently came to our studio along with Bryce Benjet, a senior attorney at the Innocence Project. I began by asking Bryce Benjet to lay out the story.

AMY GOODMAN: Bryce Benjet, senior attorney at the Innocence Project. His client Rodney Reed is scheduled to be executed by the state of Texas November 20th. When we come back, we’ll be joined by Rodney Reed’s brother and sister-in-law. Stay with us.

AMY GOODMAN: “Mercy, Mercy Me” by Marvin Gaye. This is Democracy Now! I’m Amy Goodman, as we continue to look at the case of Rodney Reed, the African-American man scheduled to be executed November 20th by the state of Texas for a murder and rape he says he did not commit. Growing evidence shows Reed was framed as part of a cover-up to protect a white police officer, Jimmy Fennell, who killed his own fiancée, Stacey Stites. More than 1.4 million people have signed an online petition to save Reed’s life. I recently sat down with two members of Rodney Reed’s family: his brother Rodrick Reed and his sister-in-law Uwana Akpan, as well as Rodney Reed’s attorney, Bryce Benjet of the Innocence Project. I asked Rodrick Reed how it felt to have his brother face the death penalty all these years.

AMY GOODMAN: That’s Rodney Reed’s brother Rodrick Reed, Rodney’s sister-in-law Uwana Akpan and his attorney Bryce Benjet of the Innocence Project. Rodney Reed is scheduled to be executed by the state of Texas November 20th for the murder of Stacey Stites in 1996. In late October, Reed’s legal team filed an application for clemency with the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles after a man revealed that Stacey Stites’ fiancé, Jimmy Fennell, a white ex-police officer, had admitted to the murder while he was in prison for another crime. I want to end with the words of Rodney Reed speaking recently from death row to Dr. Phil.

AMY GOODMAN: That’s Rodney Reed speaking to Dr. Phil on death row in Texas. Rodney Reed is scheduled to be executed by the state of Texas November 20th.

219140,freedombunker--2019-01-17--Watch a Florida Cop Botch a Drug Field Test on Video Then Arrest an Innocent Man,1/17/2019,freedombunker,"Watch a Florida Cop Botch a Drug Field Test on Video, Then Arrest an Innocent Man","Body camera footage obtained by Reason appears to show a now-fired Florida sheriff's deputy blatantly lying about the results of a roadside drug test during a traffic stop last year.

The video shows the April 17, 2018, traffic stop of Florida resident Steve Vann by former Jackson County Sheriff's deputy Zachary Wester. Vann was subsequently charged with possession of methamphetamines and paraphernalia as a result of the traffic stop, but state prosecutors later dropped those charges as part of a review of more than 250 cases that Wester was involved in since his hiring in 2016.

State prosecutors have dropped criminal charges in more than 100 cases involving Wester after body cam footage released last September showed the officer allegedly planting drugs in a car during another traffic stop. A Florida judge also vacated the sentences of eight people whose convictions were based on evidence and testimony by Wester. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement launched an investigation into Wester, and several people have filed federal lawsuits against him.

In the body cam footage obtained by Reason of Vann's arrest last year, Wester searches Vann's truck after pulling him over for a traffic violation and appears to find a small plastic baggie in the vehicle's center console.

""Honesty is going to go a long way with me,"" Wester tells Vann, holding up the baggie. ""Have you ever seen this before?""

""No, no what is that?"" Vann says. ""Where'd you get that?""

""The center console,"" Wester says as he walks back to his cruiser to perform a roadside test of the baggie for methamphetamines.

""There ain't no way, man,"" a distraught Vann says. ""Oh my god, you gotta be fucking kidding me.""

Wester then uses a Nark II field test for methamphetamines and MDMA. According to the manufacturer, the field test ""will develop an IMMEDIATE (within 2 seconds) Dark Blue color as a positive reaction after breakage and agitation of the 3rd ampoule. If the color development is an immediate Pink slowly transforming to Lavender, you DO NOT have either Methamphetamine or MDMA.""

Wester shakes the field test for about 10 seconds, checking it several times, but it remains red. Looking right at the small bag of pinkish red liquid, Wester then says ""blue"" and returns to Vann to tell him the substance tested presumptively positive for methamphetamines. The field test occurs at roughly the 3:45 mark in the video above.

The Jackson County Sheriff's Office confirmed to Reason that it uses the Nark II field test and that a positive result for methamphetamines should turn the solution blue.

Wester presses Vann to admit that he knew the meth was in his car, but Vann, breaking into tears at several points, continues to deny knowing where it came from. He appears confused and devastated throughout the exchange.

""I'm going to have to take your vehicle, too,"" Wester tells Vann. ""Listen buddy, I don't think you're a bad guy.""

At one point, at around 11 minutes 50 seconds into the footage, Wester drops some of Vann's personal effects into the trunk of his police cruiser, at which point he picks up the field test and looks at it again. It's still clearly red.

The Tallahassee Democrat first reported last September that local prosecutors were dropping dozens of cases involving Wester after body cam footage appeared to show him planting a small baggie of meth in a woman's car during a traffic stop.

The Democrat later published accounts by several other people who claimed they were framed by Wester during traffic stops. Before joining the Jackson County Sheriff's Office, Wester was fired from his previous job at the Liberty County Sheriff's Office for for inappropriate relations with women, the newspaper reported.

In 2016, The New York Times reported that the $2 roadside field tests that Wester and countless other police officers around the country use to establish probable cause to arrest someone for drug possession are unreliable and easy to misinterpret:

There are no established error rates for the field tests, in part because their accuracy varies so widely depending on who is using them and how. Data from the Florida Department of Law Enforcement lab system show that 21 percent of evidence that the police listed as methamphetamine after identifying it was not methamphetamine, and half of those false positives were not any kind of illegal drug at all. In one notable Florida episode, Hillsborough County sheriff's deputies produced 15 false positives for methamphetamine in the first seven months of 2014. When we examined the department's records, they showed that officers, faced with somewhat ambiguous directions on the pouches, had simply misunderstood which colors indicated a positive result.

Such tests are not admissible evidence in court in most jurisdictions in the U.S. Instead, samples are sent to state forensic labs for verification.

Many of Wester's victims had prior criminal records for things like drug possession. They were, in other words, easy targets. No one would believe their word against a police officer's. If Wester hadn't been wearing a body cam, and if he hadn't of been sloppy enough to film his amateur sleight-of-hand attempts and lies, all of their charges would likely stand, and he would still be patrolling the streets.",Ed Krayewski,http://freedombunker.com/2019/01/17/watch-a-florida-cop-botch-a-drug-field-test-on-video-then-arrest-an-innocent-man/,2019-01-17 20:30:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
219544,freedombunker--2019-02-06--Alabama Cop Justified in Killing Innocent Man Says State Attorney General,2/6/2019,freedombunker,"Alabama Cop ‘Justified’ in Killing Innocent Man, Says State Attorney General","The Hoover, Alabama, police officer who killed the wrong man in a mall on Thanksgiving Day won't face criminal charges for his actions. Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall's office says the officer was ""justified"" in shooting 21-year-old Emantic ""E.J."" Bradford, Jr.

In the immediate aftermath of the incident, police had a difficult time getting their story straight. There had been a shooting at the mall that injured 18-year-old Brian Wilson and a 12-year-old bystander, Molly Davis. Bradford was not involved in that shooting, but at some point, he took his gun out. Other shoppers may have done the same, Al.com reported in late November. Bejmanin Crump, an attorney for Bradford's family, has suggested Bradford was trying to help people in the midst of the chaos following the shooting.

Bradford ended up being shot and killed by a Hoover Police officer who was on duty at the mall. Police initially claimed Bradford was the suspected shooter, and then said less than two days later that he probably wasn't. Police eventually arrested a different suspect, Erron Martez Dequan Brown, who claims he shot Brian Wilson in self-defense, according to a report Marshall's office released yesterday.

That 24-page report explains why the unidentified cop who killed Bradford, referred to as ""Officer 1,"" won't face charges. ""Officer 1 reasonably exercised his official duties, powers, or functions when he shot,"" the report reads. ""Accordingly, Alabama law declares his action 'justified and not criminal.'""

The report includes testimony from multiple witnesses and police. Marshall's office also released partial surveillance footage of both shootings taken from two nearby stores. In describing the footage, the report reads:

It's difficult to see the first shooting. However, the footage does show the scene turning chaotic in its aftermath. Brown appears to move away from the scene before starting to go the other way. Bradford only makes it a few steps before he drops to the ground, and a small black object appears to fall from his grasp. The footage can be seen below:

""I observed two males who were not running away, but, instead, were standing near the railing in front of FootAction,"" Officer 1 said in a written statement. ""Next, I observed an armed suspect quickly moving towards the two males standing near the railing. The suspect was advancing on the two males and had a black handgun in his right hand. I fired my duty weapon at the armed suspect to stop him."" After shooting Bradford, Officer 1 said he ""asked the uninjured male…if the suspect was the only shooter. I understood an affirmative response to my last question.""

In spoken testimony, Officer 1 said he thought Bradford ""was going to murder Brian Wilson and AC,"" according to the report. His body camera was in standby mode until after he shot Bradford.

Officer 1's partner at the time, identified as ""Officer 2,"" backed up Officer 1's testimony. ""Officer 2 stated that, at the time, he believed E.J. Bradford had shot Brian Wilson,"" the report reads.

The report also cited three civilian witnesses. Two of those witnesses said they believed Bradford to be the shooter, though neither witnessed the original shooting. (They simply heard gunshots.) Both of those witnesses said they heard Officer 1 tell Bradford to drop his weapon three times before shooting him. But according to the report, ""Officer 1 stated that he did not give any commands due to the imminent nature of the threat."" The report said it's ""unclear"" whether he actually warned Bradford to put his gun on the ground or not. A third witness, meanwhile, simply ""stated that she saw a police officer shoot E.J. Bradford three times.""

An official autopsy from the Jefferson County Coroner Medical Examiner's Office did indeed say Bradford was hit three times, seemingly confirming much of what an independent autopsy had previously concluded. Bradford was shot once in the back of the head, once in the neck, and once above his right buttock, the official autopsy found.

The report said Officer 1 was ultimately justified in shooting Bradford because he ""acted as a reasonable officer would have under the circumstances"" and because he ""acted in accordance with nationally-accepted standards for 'active shooter' scenarios.""

But Bradford's family isn't buying it. ""I'm outraged,"" Bradford's mother, April Pipkins, told The New York Times. ""In no way was justice served,"" she added. Another witness, Ashlyn McMillan, told the Times that Bradford was helping get shoppers to safety in the first shooting's aftermath.

""It is outrageous and beyond comprehension that the Alabama Attorney General has concluded that it was reasonable for a trained law enforcement officer to fatally shoot an innocent civilian, one whose only action was an attempt to help protect the public and whose only 'crime' was being black,"" Crump said in a statement emailed to media outlets. Crump claims the footage released by Marshall's office does not tell the whole story, and he's calling for the ""full, unedited video"" to be ""released immediately.""

At a preliminary court hearing earlier this month, Special Agent Pete Acosta of the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency, which investigated the case, testified that Wilson had hit Brown, prompting Brown to shoot him. It's not clear if Bradford knew Brown, but they appear to have been connected by a mutual friend, Robert Poole, who also testified at the hearing, according to Al.com. Poole said he was with Brown and another friend at the mall when Bradford asked about his whereabouts over Facebook. Bradford and Wilson, who attended the same high school as Poole, then showed up at the mall prior to the shooting.

Clearly, there are still may questions left unanswered about what led to that first shooting. Bradford, however, does not appear to have done anything wrong. And clearly, he was not responsible for the original shooting. According to Marshall's report, ""there is no evidence that"" Bradford's gun ""was fired at the incident scene,"" though he did chamber a round prior to being shot.

It's also worth noting that the attorney general's report suggests Officer 1 was partly justified because of the supposed threat Bradford posed, even though there's no evidence he had or was about to engage in any wrongdoing. The report reads:

In other words, Officer 1 was justified in killing Bradford for exercising his Second Amendment right to carry a firearm. (Alabama is an open-carry state, and Bradford's father has claimed Bradford has a permit for his gun.) The report suggests that even if Officer 1 did not think Bradford was the shooter, he was right to take him down because he was carrying a weapon. The attorney general's office is operating under the assumption that citizens should not take action to protect themselves and/or others in situations like these.

We saw this type of thinking play out in Chicago last November. An armed security guard returned fire on an active shooter and eventually pinned him to the ground. But the guard was shot and killed when police arrived on the scene and thought he was the bad guy.

As I've previously written, neither man deserved to die, and both actually appear to have been the proverbial ""good guy with a gun."" The fact that police shot first and asked questions later just makes their deaths all the more tragic.",Ed Krayewski,http://freedombunker.com/2019/02/06/alabama-cop-justified-in-killing-innocent-man-says-state-attorney-general/,2019-02-06 18:45:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
220656,freedombunker--2019-04-11--He Was Tased Arrested and Totally Innocent Now Hes Suing,4/11/2019,freedombunker,"He Was Tased, Arrested and Totally Innocent. Now He’s Suing.","Nate Carter is bringing a $3 million lawsuit against the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee, its police department, and the officer responsible for his tasing and wrongful arrest.

According to the complaint, the April 2018 incident began when police responded to a 911 call about a man threatening the caller with a gun. The caller described the suspect as a black man with short hair, who was heavy-set and wearing green and black pants.

The suspect had fled by the time police arrived. Instead, they saw Carter, who was wearing a purple t-shirt and black shorts. Officer Cody Thomas asked Carter to identify himself. Carter, who said he was checking his mail outside, responded that Thomas was not welcome to come to his house. The situation escalated with Thomas telling Carter, ""How about you watch your mouth before your ass gets thrown in the back of my car.""

Thomas pulled out a Taser and threatened to shoot Carter's ""fucking dog,"" which was barking in the front yard. Carter attempted to go into his house, at which point Thomas shot Carter in the back with his taser, causing him to fall on his front porch. Carter managed to make his way inside, and Thomas called for backup. Carter then re-emerged from his home with his family while several officers, including Thomas, pointed guns and tasers toward Carter, his family, and his dog. After the family was out of the way, the officers moved to arrest Carter.

Thomas later claimed that Carter was standing in the street and ""bolted"" prior to the incident. He charged Carter with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Those charges were thrown out by a judge in November and Carter is now suing.

This is not the first incident involving Officer Thomas. In February 2018, Thomas and other officers entered the home of Dale Edmonds after a neighbor told emergency services that someone was sitting in a black vehicle in Edmonds' driveway. The person in the vehicle was a Department of Child Services agent who was waiting while a second agent was meeting with Edmonds inside of the house. Though the agent explained to officers the purpose of their trip, Thomas and others entered the house through the backdoor without a warrant. The officers led Edmonds, his housemate, and the agent outside of the house at gunpoint, but not before Thomas ""manhandled"" Edmonds, who was recovering from a gunshot wound.

Robin Flores, an attorney and former police officer who works on police brutality cases, is representing Carter. Their suit argues that the city ""has long-established patterns of overlooking or providing excuses and reasons to justify the misconduct of its officers."" Flores told Reason that the complaint highlights how the city fails to ""discipline and supervise"" officers. The complaint lists other reports of bad policing by Chattanooga police dating back to 2003, including excessive force, lingering investigations, domestic abuse, and sexual harassment.

Flores told Reason that the Supreme Court has ruled that the language Carter used during his arrest is a form of protected speech. In 1974, the court ruled against a Louisiana statute that criminalized the use of obscene language while an officer is performing their duties. Justices argued that the law was too broad to fit within the legal definition of ""fighting words"" and had the potential to be abused in instances lacking a valid reason for an arrest.

Though Thomas' body camera was rolling during the incident, he turned his cruiser's dash camera off in violation of the department's policy. At one point, Thomas' hand covers his body camera. The complaint argues that this was done either in an attempt to turn it off or conceal his interaction with Carter.

Flores says that the footage available in both Carter's case and in the Edmonds case is ""critical enough to bring a claim"" against Thomas, the department, and the city. In other instances, footage has been enough to drop charges and reopen the cases of offending officers. He also mentions another case where he dismissed a suit after his client's version of events did not match the camera footage. This, he says, also protects police officers.",Ed Krayewski,http://freedombunker.com/2019/04/11/he-was-tased-arrested-and-totally-innocent-now-hes-suing/,2019-04-11 18:35:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
220974,freedombunker--2019-04-30--Chicago Impounds Innocent Peoples Cars and Soaks Them in Fines Now Its Getting Sued,4/30/2019,freedombunker,Chicago Impounds Innocent People’s Cars and Soaks Them in Fines. Now It’s Getting Sued,"Chicago impounds thousands of people's cars a year, including cars owned by people who have committed no crime, and forces them through an expensive, bureaucratic maze to get their car back. This process that violates residents' constitutional rights, according to a new lawsuit filed against the city Monday evening.

The Institute for Justice filed a class-action lawsuit in Illinois state court alleging that Chicago's impound program violates residents' guarantee of due process, as well as protections against excessive fines and unreasonable seizures, under both the Illinois and U.S. constitutions.

""Owners find themselves in a labyrinthine impound system that is plagued by serious procedural flaws,"" the suit says. ""Even innocent owners get caught up in this system, facing hefty fines and fees when someone else used their car to commit a crime without the car owner's knowledge.""

A Reason investigation published last year described how Chicago's punitive impound program soaks people in fines and fees and deprives them indefinitely of their transportation, whether or not they actually committed an offense, in an effort to reduce its massive annual budget deficits. It also operates independently from the state's courts, meaning that even in cases where a defendant beats a criminal charge and/or a civil asset forfeiture case, they can still be found liable for thousands of dollars in fines and storage fees, and have their cars held until they pay or relinquish them to the city, by Chicago.

That's exactly what happened to Spencer Byrd, a 51-year-old resident of Harvey, Illinois whose impound case was featured by Reason and is now a named plaintiff in the Institute for Justice lawsuit.

Byrd, a part-time auto mechanic says he was giving a client a lift in his 1996 Cadillac DeVille one evening in June, 2016, when he was pulled over by Chicago police and searched. Byrd was clean, but his passenger, a man he says he'd never met before, had heroin in his pocket.

The police released Byrd without charging him with a crime, but his car was seized and dually claimed by both the Cook County State Attorney's Office and the city of Chicago. He's been fighting for nearly three years to get it back.

A state judge ordered Byrd's car released after he filed a financial hardship motion, but the city refused to return it, claiming he owed money under the city's municipal code.

Even after a state judge declared Byrd innocent in the civil forfeiture case against his Cadillac in Illinois state court, he was still found liable for violating Chicago's municipal code in the city's administrative hearings court, which has a low standard of evidence and almost no procedural protections for defendants.

In the meantime, Byrd's livelihood has suffered. His primary trade is carpentry, but his tools have been locked in his car since it was impounded. The city has refused to let him retrieve them, or his car, until he pays his accumulated fines and fees, which according to the lawsuit now stand at more than $17,000.

""If you do wrong, fine, but I didn't do nothing wrong,"" Byrd tells Reason. ""I should have had my car released to me with no fines or anything—thank you, sorry for the inconvenience, and I'm on my merry way—instead of trying to get some type of revenue from me. I was proven innocent, and they still didn't want to act right.""

Byrd is far from alone. A WBEZ analysis of Chicago's massive impound program found that in 2017 alone, the city impounded more than 22,000 cars for violations of its municipal code, which includes dozens of impoundable offenses ranging from drug possession to drag racing to having illegal fireworks.

The fines for those violations are steep, ranging from $500 to $3,000, and that doesn't include towing and storage fees, which accumulate at $20 a day for the first five days, and $35 a a day after that. Given that these cases can take weeks, if not months, to wind through the system, the fees can often exceed the fines themselves.

A Reason analysis of data from the Chicago Administrative Hearings Department showed Chicago fined motorists $17 million over a 12-month period between 2017 and 2018. About $10 million of those fines were for driving on a suspended license, and more than $3 million were for drug offenses like the one that resulted in the impoundment of Byrd's car.

Chicago can hold seized cars indefinitely. There is also no statute of limitations on impound fines and fees in Chicago. The debt can follow someone for life.

Chicago's impound racket is both easy to be ensnared in and hard to escape. There are only three narrow defenses for those whose cars are impounded for municipal violations in Chicago, and being an innocent owner isn't one of them.

""You're talking about a lot of money for something that you may not have been responsible for,"" says Institute for Justice attorney Diana Simpson. ""The lack of an innocent owner protection really violates two different kinds of constitutional protections: both the excessive fines and fees protection, as well as due process.""

The case of two of the other named plaintiffs in the Institute for Justice lawsuit, Jerome Davis and Veronica Walker-Davis, exemplify what critics say is the procedural nightmare people face when their cars are impounded in Chicago.

In May of last year, the couple dropped their 2006 Lexus off at a Chicago body shop following an accident. When the repairs dragged on for longer than expected, the shop first said it was waiting for parts, but eventually the couple learned the truth: An employee of the shop had driven their car on a suspended license and was pulled over. Their Lexus was now sitting at one of Chicago's six impound lots.

The city had never informed the couple that their car had been impounded, according to the lawsuit, and Veronica Walker-Davis had to travel in person to the city's administrative hearings building to request a hearing to fight the impoundment.

""I'm thinking that I'm just going to go and give a statement, show proof that my car wasn't in my possession, and everything will be okay, but in fact it turned into a nightmare,"" she says. ""I felt like I was pretty much in The Twilight Zone.""

The Twilight Zone is Room 110 in Chicago's administrative hearings building, a small courtroom where the city churns through its impound cases at a rate of roughly one every 10-15 minutes, five days a week.

Because the hearings are civil matters, not criminal, there is no right to a lawyer, and Walker-Davis found herself standing across from a lawyer for the city of Chicago. She tried to explain to the administrative hearing judge what had happened, but it made no difference. She was found liable for violating the city code and would have to pay nearly $2,500 to get their car out of impound.

""I felt like crap,"" she says. ""I felt like a criminal.""

In late March of this year, The couple managed to find a pro bono lawyer and negotiate their fine down to $1,170, but when they arrived with cash in hand, they were told the registration on their car had lapsed in the more than six months it had been sitting in an impound lot, and the city would not release it without a current registration.

Walker-Davis rushed the next day to get their registration renewed, which cost another $101, and got the city to agree to extend the deadline for the couple to pay their impound fines. In an email provided to Reason, a lawyer for Chicago's law department wrote to the couple: ""The City will agree to extend the time for you to pay the settlement agreement to 4/12/19.""

But when the couple showed up to retrieve their car on April 10, it was gone. The city had already sold it off. According to WBEZ, Chicago sells many of the cars it impounds for paltry amounts under $200, and almost all of them are sold to a single towing contractor.

The Institute for Justice is hoping that a recent Supreme Court case will bolster their claim that Chicago's rapacious impound program fines people so much and affords them so few avenues of escape that it violates the Constitution.

The Supreme Court ruled earlier this year in Timbs v. Indiana—the case of an Indiana man whose $42,000 Land Rover was seized for a drug felony—that states are bound by the Eighth Amendment's protections against excessive fines and fees. Although the Court did not define exactly what constitutes ""excessive,"" it opened the door for civil liberties groups to press the issue.

In 2017, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down Los Angeles' automatic 30-day impound law, ruling that it amounted to an unconstitutional seizure under the Fourth Amendment. While state and federal courts have repeatedly upheld Chicago's impound program in the past, the Institute for Justice hopes that it can build on the recent Supreme Court decision, as well as other cases that have addressed the government's use of fines and fees to generate revenue.

""We think we've got a really great chance, and we think the courts will agree with us that the system is just too much,"" Simpson says. ""It's bringing in an entirely huge amount of money for the city of Chicago—there's about 22,000 cars that go in through this system each year—and that's not the role of the government.""",Ed Krayewski,http://freedombunker.com/2019/04/29/chicago-impounds-innocent-peoples-cars-and-soaks-them-in-fines-now-its-getting-sued/,2019-04-30 02:45:55+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
223246,freedombunker--2019-11-01--Federal Court Rules there is no Taking if the Police Destroy an Innocent Person’s House During a Law,11/1/2019,freedombunker,Federal Court Rules there is no Taking if the Police Destroy an Innocent Person’s House During a Law Enforcement Operation,"Earlier this week, the US Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment does not require the government to compensate an innocent man for the destruction of his house during a police operation:

The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment requires the government to pay ""just compensation"" to property owners any time their land or other property is ""taken"" by the state. That includes many situations where the government destroys or damages the property in question, rather than appropriates it for its own use. For example, in 2013, the Supreme Court unanimously held that a taking can occur as a result of the government deliberately flooding land. As far back as 1872, the Court ruled that ""where real estate is actually invaded by superinduced additions of water, earth, sand, or other material . . . so as to effectually destroy or impair its usefulness, it is a taking, within the meaning of the Constitution."" It seems pretty obvious that the Lech home was ""effectually destroy[ed]"" by the grenades and other ""material"" that the Greenwood Village police fired at it.

Why then, did the court rule that no taking had occurred, thereby denying the Lech family any right to compensation? Because the destruction of the house occurred in the course of a law enforcement operation intended to promote ""the safety of the public"":

[A]s the [Supreme] Court explained in Mugler, when the state acts to preserve the ""safety of the public,"" the state ""is not, and, consistent[] with the existence and safety of organized society, cannot be, burdened with the condition that the state must compensate [affected property owners] for pecuniary losses they may sustain"" in the process…. [W]hen the state acts pursuant to its police power, rather than the power of eminent domain, its actions do not constitute a taking for purposes of the Takings Clause. And we further hold that this distinction remains dispositive in cases that, like this one, involve the direct physical appropriation or invasion of private property….

The court is right to point out that this distinction between the ""police power"" and eminent domain has been adopted in many of previous takings decisions immunizing law enforcement agents from liability. The main relatively new aspect of this case is applying the distinction to the physical invasion or destruction of property, as well as to ""regulatory takings"" where the government merely restricts the owner's ability to use his or her land. But the rule still makes no sense, and should be done away with.

The distinction between ""police power"" and ""eminent domain""—with only the latter leading to a taking—is a false dichotomy. In many situations, courts have ruled that a taking has occurred even if the government did not try to use eminent domain—its authority to formally condemn private property for public use. That includes numerous cases involving both regulatory takings and physical invasions.

The fact that the ""police power"" may have been involved does not normally immunize the government from takings liability. As the Lech decision notes, the police power extends to government actions ""for the protection of public health, safety, and welfare."" Modern jurisprudence defines these concepts very broadly. Yet, in many contexts, courts nonetheless routinely rule that takings have occurred even though the purpose of the law at issue was to protect health or safety. For example, in the classic 1922 case of Pennsylvania Coal v. Mahon, the Supreme Court ruled that a prohibition on mining can qualify as a taking, even though its purpose was to protect the safety of people and property on the surface. Similarly, environmental regulations can sometimes qualify as takings if they destroy enough of the value of a property, even though their purpose is often to promote health or safety.

Cases where the government does go through the formal process of eminent domain often also involve the protection of health or safety. For example, the condemnation of property to build a road can increase health and safety if the new road is safer than the old, and thereby reduces the rate of traffic accidents. Yet, the government could not use that fact to seize the property and build on it without paying compensation.

Even if the government has a good reason to seize or destroy private property, the Takings Clause requires payment of compensation. As the Supreme Court famously stated in Armstrong v. United States (1960), ""[t]he Fifth Amendment's guarantee that private property shall not be taken for a public use without just compensation was designed to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole."" The history and original meaning of the Takings Clause also supports the notion that exercises of the ""police power"" can be takings.

Outside the context of law-enforcement operations, the fact that the government was trying to promote public safety does not create blanket immunity from having to compensate innocent owners whose property is taken or destroyed in the process. There is no good reason to exempt law-enforcement operations from takings liability of the same kind that applies to other government actions that might enhance public safety.

Indeed, as the Supreme Court recognized in the 2015 Horne case, the Takings Clause was inspired in the first place in part by revulsion at both British and American forces' seizure of property during the colonial era and the Revolutionary War. Many of these British actions were, of course, undertaken for the purpose of enforcing British law against recalcitrant colonists.

One possible distinction between police operations and other government actions is that the former may require quick decisions in order to ensure the capture of suspects. Thus, it might be unnecessarily burdensome to require police officers to consider potential takings liability at such moment. But the need for rapid decision-making is by no means a universal trait of police actions that damage or destroy private property. As Radley Balko shows in his important book, The Rise of the Warrior Cop, law enforcement operations using destructive military-style tactics are actually often planned in advance. Even when quick decision-making is needed, line officers do not have to weigh takings issues on the spot. Such matters could be considered in advance by their superiors in formulating general tactical guidelines for their subordinates.

If the use of various destructive tactics pays large dividends for public safety, then the government can continue using them, secure in the knowledge that the compensation paid was well worth the price. And it is only proper that the costs be borne by the general public whose safety these operations protect, not by innocent owners who had the misfortune of having their property destroyed because it was in the wrong place at the wrong time.

If, on the other hand, authorities find that they routinely end up paying compensation that far exceeds any plausible benefit arising from the use of such aggressive tactics, then they would be well-advised to issue stricter guidelines for the use of force by their officers. Perhaps they shouldn't seize and destroy as much property as they currently do.

In this way, Takings Clause liability not only promotes fairness for innocent property owners, but also can help increase the efficiency of law enforcement. The government will have an incentive to prevent them from undertaking destructive operations that harm the public more than they protect it.

The Supreme Court would do well to overrule this case and make clear that the Takings Clause protects innocent owners whose property is destroyed during the course of law enforcement operations. Unfortunately, I am far from optimistic that will actually happen.

In commenting on this case, Clark Neily of the Cato Institute points out that ""With an honorable and ethical gov[ernment], the constitutional question never comes up because they [would] just compensate the owner as a matter of common decency."" But, as Clark also notes, when it comes to government policy, honor, ethics, and common decency are often in short supply. Thomas Jefferson put it well: ""in questions of power then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution."" Though Jefferson didn't always live up to this principle himself, it is valid all the same. The chains of the Takings Clause should bind law enforcement no less than other agents of the state.",Ed Krayewski,http://freedombunker.com/2019/10/31/federal-court-rules-there-is-no-taking-if-the-police-destroy-an-innocent-persons-house-during-a-law-enforcement-operation/,"Fri, 01 Nov 2019 03:22:32 +0000","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
235424,hitandrun--2019-07-24--How Confirmation Bias Sends Innocent People to Prison,7/24/2019,hitandrun,How Confirmation Bias Sends Innocent People to Prison,"Last week an Oklahoma judge freed Corey Atchison, who had spent 28 years in prison for a murder he has always said he did not commit, after concluding that he had been convicted based on the false testimony of ""purported eyewitnesses"" who had been ""coerced"" by prosecutors. The next day, an Idaho judge exonerated Christopher Tapp, who had served more than two decades for rape and murder, after DNA evidence implicated another man, who confessed to the crimes.

While cases like these often feature wrongdoing by individual prosecutors and police officers, a new study suggests the problem is deeper. After analyzing 50 wrongful convictions and other investigative failures, Texas State criminologists Kim Rossmo and Joycelyn Pollock found that confirmation bias, reinforced by groupthink and strong incentives to quickly identify the perpetrators of highly publicized crimes, figures prominently in the mistakes that send innocent people to prison.

Once police decide they have the right suspect, Rossmo and Pollock report in the Northeastern University Law Review, they tend to develop ""tunnel vision"" that obscures other possibilities. They become focused on building a case against the person they've decided is guilty, ignore or minimize countervailing evidence, and interpret ambiguous evidence in a way that supports their initial conclusions.

After Angela Correa, a 15-year-old high school student in Peekskill, New York, was raped and strangled to death in 1989, for example, police quickly settled on one of her classmates, Jeffrey Deskovic, as their sole suspect. ""Suffering from tunnel vision, detectives pursued a single-minded course of action designed to get Deskovic to confess,"" Rossmo and Pollock write. ""Police did not look for other suspects despite the presence of exculpatory physical evidence. In a classic confirmation bias pattern, detectives changed their theory of the case when the DNA test results came back excluding Deskovic.""

Deskovic was convicted in 1990 based on a false confession he later retracted. For years the Westchester County district attorney, Jeanine Pirro, now a Fox News host who opines on justice, rejected Deskovic's requests to compare the DNA evidence against a criminal database. Deskovic was not exonerated until 2006, after he had served 16 years in prison, when a new D.A. approved testing that identified the actual perpetrator.

Christopher Tapp's conviction also was based on a false confession that was contradicted by DNA evidence, the pattern in about a third of the 367 cases in which the Innocence Project has used such evidence to clear people who were wrongly convicted. ""Interrogations are not a quest for information,"" observes the Innocence Project's Vanessa Potkin. ""The purpose is to get an admission.""

In another case that Rossmo and Pollock examined, Bruce Lisker was wrongly convicted in 1985 of stabbing his mother to death at their home in Sherman Oaks, California. He was not released until 2009, at which point he had served 26 years, after a judge determined that he had been convicted based on false evidence, including the testimony of a jailhouse snitch police knew was unreliable.

""Investigators coerced a confession (quickly recanted) from the 17-year-old teenager through the offer of a plea bargain,"" Rossmo and Pollock write. ""A rush to judgment followed by tunnel vision led to confirmation bias. Exculpatory evidence was ignored, while the alibi of an alternative and viable suspect was never checked despite inconsistencies in his story.""

Confirmation bias is common and hard to root out. Rossmo and Pollock recommend training in ""cognitive de-biasing,"" better evidence procedures, closer supervision, and a general awareness of cognitive biases and the factors that let them run riot.

Rossmo and Pollock also note that the ""probable cause"" standard for arresting someone, which creates momentum toward a conviction, is a low bar that does not require showing the suspect is more likely than not to be guilty. ""A probable cause that is not probable is inconsistent with both language and mathematics,"" they write. ""The most certain way to prevent a wrongful conviction is to minimize wrongful arrests of innocent people.""",Jacob Sullum (jsullum@reason.com),http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/reason/HitandRun/~3/kPMlEX0iksk/,2019-07-24 04:01:15+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But Missouri Still Imprisoned an Innocent Man for 24 Years.,"The St. Louis Circuit Attorney's Office will give a new trial to Lamar Johnson, who was convicted of capital murder in 1995 after the lead detective falsified witness statements and bribed a man to identify Johnson as the killer.

For Johnson to have been guilty, he would have had to leave an apartment party, travel three miles, kill the victim, and return on foot to the same party within a matter of five minutes. St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner has now filed a 67-page motion to vacate the conviction. It and an accompanying investigative report say that Johnson was only convicted after police and prosecutors relied on ""perjured testimony, suppression of exculpatory and material impeachment evidence of secret payments to the sole eyewitness, and undisclosed Brady material related to a jailhouse informant with a history of incentivized cooperation with the State.""

Joseph Nickerson, the lead detective at the time, was found to have fabricated parts of his investigation, including falsifying four witness statements and bribing a man $4,000 to identify Johnson as the shooter at trial. Johnson continued to sit in prison even after the actual killers confessed to their crime, and absolved Johnson of any involvement, in 1996 and 2002.

The Midwest Innocence Project (MIP), which has long represented Johnson, praised Gardner in a press release for filing a motion for a new trial. ""We don't expect prosecutors or law enforcement officers to be perfect—but we should expect that once overwhelming evidence of innocence and government misconduct come to light, that prosecutors fulfill their duty to administer justice by correcting those injustices,"" said MIP attorney Lindsay Runnels.",Zuri Davis (zuri.davis@reason.com),http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/reason/HitandRun/~3/UhD91WU7ZcY/,2019-07-30 16:00:46+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
236455,hitandrun--2019-10-06--States Are Depriving Innocent People of Their Second Amendment Rights,10/6/2019,hitandrun,States Are Depriving Innocent People of Their Second Amendment Rights,"Shortly after 5 a.m. on November 5, 2018, two police officers arrived at Gary Willis' house in Glen Burnie, Maryland. They were there to take away his guns. They ended up killing him instead.

According to the Anne Arundel County Police Department, the 61-year-old man, who at that hour presumably had just been awakened by the officers' knocking, answered the door with a gun in his hand. He put it down when he saw who was there. Upon learning that the two officers had come to serve him with an ""extreme risk protective order"" (ERPO) that barred him from possessing firearms, police said, Willis became ""irate"" and picked up the weapon again. As one officer tried to wrestle the gun away from Willis, it went off, whereupon the other officer shot him.

Police Chief Timothy Altomare subsequently argued that the incident illustrated the need for Maryland's ERPO law, which had taken effect barely a month before. ""If you look at this morning's outcome,"" he told the Annapolis Capital, a newspaper whose headquarters had been the site of a mass shooting the previous June, ""it's tough for us to say 'Well, what did we prevent?' Because we don't know what we prevented or could've prevented. What would've happened if we didn't go there at 5 a.m.?""

Well, for one thing, Gary Willis probably would still be alive.

Altomare invites us to speculate that Willis might have used a gun to kill someone. Yet at the time of his death, the only evidence to support that concern seems to have been a complaint from his sister, who reportedly obtained the temporary ERPO against her brother after a family argument during which he said something that alarmed her. Willis had no opportunity to challenge that claim, and he had no idea he had been stripped of his Second Amendment rights until police arrived at his door early in the morning with the court order in hand.

Anne Arundel County police did not respond to my inquiries, and the Maryland courts have declined to provide records of the case, which are confidential under state law unless a judge rules otherwise. Based on interviews with relatives, local news outlets reported that the ERPO stemmed from an argument the day before about the care of Willis' elderly mother. According to WBFF, the local Fox station, ""Gary Willis struggle[d] with alcoholism"" but ""family say he wasn't dangerous, just strongly opinionated.""

Michele Willis, Gary's niece, gave a similar account in an interview with The Baltimore Sun, saying her uncle ""likes to speak his mind"" but ""wouldn't hurt anybody."" She added that his fatal encounter with the police seemed senseless. ""I'm just dumbfounded now,"" she said. ""They didn't need to do what they did.""

Maryland is one of 17 states with so-called red flag laws, most of which were enacted following the February 2018 massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. After the mass shootings in El Paso and Dayton in August, President Donald Trump endorsed red flag laws as a way of preventing such crimes by disarming would-be mass murderers. But judging from the available data, the court orders authorized by such laws are usually aimed at preventing suicide rather than homicide. The evidence on whether they succeed in doing that is mixed. So far there is no solid evidence that they prevent homicides, even though the oldest red flag law was enacted two decades ago.

One thing is certain: Taking away people's guns based on predictions of what they might do with them raises thorny due process concerns. That's especially true with laws like Maryland's, which authorize broad categories of people to seek ERPOs based on scant evidence and effectively put the burden on gun owners to demonstrate that they don't pose a threat to themselves or others. While the benefits of these laws are mostly speculative, they inevitably deprive law-abiding people of the constitutional right to armed self-defense, even when it is quite unlikely that they would use guns to hurt themselves or anyone else.

Maryland's law, which was enacted two months after the Parkland attack and took effect in October 2018, authorizes law enforcement officers, physicians, mental health specialists, and various relatives, intimates, and cohabitants to seek ERPOs. That list includes housemates, spouses, dating partners, people who have ""a child in common with the respondent,"" and anyone ""related to the respondent by blood, marriage, or adoption."" A temporary ERPO, lasting up to a week, can be issued if there are ""reasonable grounds"" to believe the respondent poses ""an immediate and present danger"" to himself or others.

At that stage, as Gary Willis discovered, respondent is a misnomer: The initial ERPO is an ex parte order, meaning its target does not have a chance to respond. A judge can extend the ex parte order for up to six months if there is ""good cause."" A final ERPO, which lasts up to a year and can be extended for another six months, can be issued after a hearing based on ""clear and convincing evidence"" that the respondent ""poses a danger"" to himself or others. In light of that language, extreme risk protective order is also a misnomer, since any level of danger—slight, great, or middling—suffices to obtain one. But at least at this point, the respondent is allowed to rebut the claims against him, although he has no right to legal representation if he can't afford it.

During the first five months after the ERPO law took effect, according to statewide data published by the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office, judges or commissioners (low-level judicial officers) approved 422 temporary or interim orders. Requests for those initial orders are almost never rejected in Maryland, and the same is true in Florida, which enacted a red flag law in March 2018.

It is not surprising that judges are disinclined to be skeptical of an applicant who claims a gun owner poses an imminent threat, since they do not want to take the blame if something terrible happens before they can hold an adversarial hearing. But what happens at the next stage, when the threat need not be imminent but the burden of proof is heavier? In Maryland, when a hearing was actually held (in some cases the petitioners did not show up), judges granted final ERPOs 62 percent of the time. In Florida, according to data from the Office of the State Courts Administrator, 1,482 hearings had been held as of March 31 and 1,409 orders had been granted, which translates into an approval rate of 95 percent.

Although the standard of proof in Florida is the same as in Maryland (clear and convincing evidence), Florida's law allows petitions only by law enforcement officers or agencies, which judges apparently find more credible than the reports of possibly aggrieved (or sincerely mistaken) spouses, dating partners, cohabitants, in-laws, or blood relatives, who accounted for most of the applications in Maryland. But that trust can be misplaced.

Consider Chris Velasquez, a University of Central Florida (UCF) student who owned no firearms, had no history of violence, and had never threatened anyone, but who nevertheless was an early target of his state's red flag law because he said some stupid things on Reddit. In a thread titled ""You guys are too weak to be a school shooter,"" Velasquez replied, ""Maybe for now but not forever."" Later, he posted ""RIP Paddock my hero"" in a thread about the autopsy of Las Vegas mass shooter Stephen Paddock and wrote ""Cruz is a hero!"" in reference to Nikolas Cruz, perpetrator of the Parkland massacre.

Those three comments resulted in a March 2018 interview with a UCF police officer, Jeffrey Panter, during which Velasquez explained that he was just ""trolling"" and trying to look tough but regretted his tasteless comments. ""I'm not a violent person,"" Velasquez told Panter. ""I would never, ever act out in violence against anybody in a mass shooting or anything of the sort."" He called the Parkland massacre ""a senseless tragedy"" and noted that a mass shooter may get his ""15 minutes of fame"" but will ""eventually be remembered as a piece of crap."" Listening to the interview, you do not get the impression that Velasquez had ever seriously contemplated committing a crime of this sort, let alone made any plans or taken any steps in that direction.

Panter refused to accept Velasquez's explanation or his assurances. During the interview he pressured, cajoled, and manipulated Velasquez into agreeing with statements that, taken out of context, made it seem like he genuinely admired Paddock and Cruz, that he identified with Cruz because both of them had been bullied as kids, and that he had repeatedly fantasized about returning to his former middle school or high school in Orlando and shooting it up.

A mandatory psychiatric assessment after the interview found that Velasquez did not meet Florida's criteria for involuntary treatment, which would have required clear and convincing evidence that, because of mental illness, there was a ""substantial likelihood"" that he would ""inflict serious bodily harm"" on himself or others ""in the near future."" Panter nevertheless referred the case to the Orlando Police Department, where Sgt. Matthew Ochiuzzo twisted Velasquez's online comments and his interview with Panter into a portrait of a deeply troubled man who was just one disappointment away from committing mass murder.

On a list of 15 possible grounds for issuing a risk protection order (as it's known in Florida), Ochiuzzo checked five, including ""there is evidence that the respondent is seriously mentally ill,"" ""respondent has committed a recent act or threat of violence,"" and ""respondent has used or threatened to use any weapons against him or herself or others."" None of that was true.

Ochiuzzo claimed Velasquez ""disclosed that he has had thoughts and urges to commit a mass shooting since his sophomore year of high school."" But Velasquez never said that. To the contrary, when Panter asked about his state of mind in high school, he said, ""I didn't have any thoughts of a school shooting.""

Ochiuzzo also claimed ""the respondent indicated that he wanted to commit the mass shootings so that he could feel the 'adrenaline rush' from the shooting."" In reality, Velasquez repeatedly said he would never commit such a crime.

Based on an affidavit that was highly misleading and in some respects blatantly inaccurate, Circuit Judge Bob LeBlanc issued a temporary risk protection order against Velasquez. But at a hearing about two weeks later, when Velasquez finally had a chance to defend himself, LeBlanc found the city had failed to provide clear and convincing evidence that Velasquez posed ""a significant danger.""

Velasquez's lawyer, Kendra Parris, says LeBlanc realized the threat described by Ochiuzzo was never more than theoretical. ""The judge asked, 'Did he actually make any threats, or was this all in response to hypothetical questions?'"" she says. ""And of course, it was all in response to hypothetical questions. Fortunately, the judge noted that this essentially amounted to thought policing and declined to issue the order.""

Although that decision may look like a victory for due process, Parris notes that LeBlanc could have reached a different conclusion, since Florida's law says judges ""may consider any relevant evidence."" The statute gives 15 examples but says the list is not exhaustive.

The law also leaves crucial terms undefined. Ochiuzzo claimed Velasquez was ""seriously mentally ill,"" for example, even though he had no diagnosis and a psychiatrist found he did not meet the criteria for commitment. Nor is it clear what ""a significant danger"" means in this context. Even assuming that judges apply such standards with precision, should they consider a 5 percent risk ""significant""? One percent? Ten percent?

""Because we can't figure out what 'significant' means, you have this high burden of proof,"" Parris says—but it relates to a probability that may be ""extraordinarily low,"" based on any evidence a judge considers relevant. ""The 'clear and convincing evidence' standard is meaningless, because the criteria are open-ended. The court literally can look at anything.""

One of Parris' clients, who lives in Broward County, Florida, posted a photo of an AR-15 rifle he had built, accompanied by the comment, ""It's done. Hooray."" On another occasion, he posted a comment criticizing teenaged gun control activists, who he said were trying to take away people's Second Amendment rights. Those two posts were enough to obtain a temporary gun confiscation order, although Parris ultimately persuaded the city to drop its petition for a final order.

Another client, former professional football player Oliver Hoyte, did not have the benefit of a lawyer at his hearing, but he really could have used one. After an argument with his aunt and her boyfriend, he says, they told police he had threatened them with a gun. In addition to that claim, Tampa police presented several other unverified allegations against Hoyte—including some they had never questioned him about, he says. They even cited a 2013 case in which he was acquitted of aggravated assault. He says video evidence contradicted the testimony of a man who claimed Hoyte had pulled a gun on him.

Parris notes that an Orange County judge last year rejected an application for a final risk protection order because it was based on events that predated the red flag law. Since the law does not say it applies retroactively, the judge said, the presumption is that it does not. That is one of the points Parris planned to raise if she managed to get a rehearing for Hoyte. She hoped to get that hearing by arguing that the government should have provided him with a public defender, although at press time she also was trying to negotiate dismissal of the case with the city.

""I feel like I should have the right to representation,"" Hoyte says. ""The judge said, 'You do have the right to representation, but the court is not going to appoint it for you.'""

Police confiscated Hoyte's Taurus 9 mm pistol, and he was forbidden to buy any other firearms for a year (possibly longer, if the order is extended). As a result, Hoyte says, he does not feel safe visiting certain neighborhoods, including the one where his family lives. ""I'm not on an equal footing with everyone else,"" he says. ""I don't have the right to bear arms, and I haven't done anything wrong. I haven't been convicted of any crime. I haven't been hospitalized. I haven't harmed anyone. This law is wrong because it eliminates due process. They're treating me as if I'm a criminal.""

The high approval rate by judges in Florida suggests the deck is stacked against respondents like Hoyte. ""All the pressure is on the other side,"" Parris says. ""There's absolutely no downside to just going ahead and issuing the order.""

Parris argues that the ""significant danger"" standard is unconstitutionally vague and that Florida's law impermissibly delegates legislative and prosecutorial authority to the police. But while such arguments can be raised on appeal, the process typically takes longer than the risk protection order lasts. ""By the time your appeal works its way through the District Court of Appeal, it's already going to be 12 months,"" Parris says. ""There's no real recourse.""

Connecticut enacted the country's first red flag law in 1999, following a mass shooting at the Connecticut Lottery Corporation's headquarters the previous year. The statute allows police officers or prosecutors to seek a gun confiscation order when they have ""probable cause"" to believe someone poses ""a risk of imminent personal injury"" to himself or others. A hearing is required within 14 days of the seizure, at which point the standard becomes ""clear and convincing evidence"" of an imminent risk. If police meet that burden, they can keep confiscated guns for up to a year.

Indiana came next, enacting a red flag law in 2005, after a man diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia used a rifle to kill one Indianapolis police officer and injure another four. That law allows a police officer to seek a gun confiscation order against someone he believes poses an imminent threat to himself or others. It also applies to someone who poses a threat that is not immediate but who ""has a propensity for violent or emotionally unstable conduct"" or who ""has a mental illness that may be controlled by medication"" but has not been diligent about taking it.

Under Indiana's law, a police officer can seize guns without a court order, in which case he is supposed to file an affidavit explaining his reasons after the fact. If a judge agrees that the officer had probable cause, police can keep the confiscated weapons. A hearing is required within 14 days, at which point the state has to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the gun owner meets the law's criteria. After at least six months have passed, the gun owner can seek the return of his property. He has to prove by ""a preponderance of the evidence"" that he ""is not dangerous.""

Notwithstanding the requirement that a hearing be held within two weeks, a 2015 study reported in the journal Behavioral Sciences and the Law found that gun owners waited an average of more than nine months before a court decided whether police could keep their firearms. When a hearing finally was scheduled, most of the gun owners did not show. But when they did, they usually prevailed, meaning judges decided the state had not met its burden of proving them dangerous. During the last 71 months covered by the eight-year study, gun owners won every contested case.

In Connecticut, by comparison, judges ruled that guns should be kept by the government in 68 percent of cases where the outcome was known, according to a 2014 Connecticut Law Review article. But outcomes were reported in less than 30 percent of cases.

Although Indiana and Connecticut both enacted red flag legislation in response to mass shootings, the laws are used mainly to protect people from their own suicidal impulses, a justification cited in 68 percent of Indiana cases from 2006 through 2013 and in 61 percent of Connecticut cases from 1999 to 2013. A study reported last year in the journal Psychiatric Services found that Indiana's law was associated with a 5 percent reduction in the overall suicide rate, while Connecticut's law was associated with a net increase in suicides. Using a different (and contested) method, a 2017 study published in Law and Contemporary Problems estimated that one suicide was prevented in Connecticut by every 10 to 20 gun seizures. A 2019 study of Indiana's law by the same researchers, reported in The Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, reached a similar conclusion.

Duke University medical sociologist Jeffrey Swanson, the lead author of those last two suicide studies, thinks due process needs improvement in Indiana. ""The state's apparent failure to comply with the statutory guideline of holding a hearing within 14 days puts a damper on the success story of suicide prevention,"" he writes in an email. ""This should be the focus of efforts to improve implementation of the law.""

Even taking the results of Swanson's studies at face value, the implication is that the vast majority of people whose guns were seized—90 to 95 percent—would not have committed suicide had they retained their firearms. Meanwhile, none of these studies reported any effect on homicides.

David Kopel, a gun policy expert at the Independence Institute in Denver, says red flag laws may have an impact, even if it is too small to be detected by looking at suicide and homicide rates. ""I think it would disarm some people who are suicidal,"" he says. ""And I think you have some people who are acting dangerously enough that a person with common sense would say, 'Wow, that guy should not have a gun.' It would address folks like that.""

But Kopel emphasizes the importance of procedural safeguards to protect the constitutional rights of gun owners, such as requiring that petitions be submitted only by law enforcement agencies after an independent investigation, allowing ex parte orders only for good cause, limiting them to one week, limiting subsequent orders to six months, requiring clear and convincing evidence, providing counsel to respondents, giving them a right to cross-examine witnesses, and letting them sue people who file false and malicious petitions. He also recommends giving gun owners advance notice of confiscation orders unless there are special reasons not to do so, a policy that might have made a crucial difference in Gary Willis' case.

Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox, an expert on mass shootings, shares Kopel's concern that suddenly seizing guns can make violence more likely. ""If you have an individual who's angry, bitter, threatening other people, [and] owns a gun,"" Fox told Reason's Nick Gillespie in August, ""the attempt to take that gun away can actually precipitate the very violent act that you're trying to prevent.""

No existing law meets all of Kopel's criteria. Washington state allows an even longer list of people to file petitions than Maryland does, including former spouses, former girlfriends and boyfriends, and former roommates. California's list is almost as long, and a pending bill would expand it further, adding employers, co-workers, and school personnel. Colorado is the only state that guarantees a lawyer for respondents, and no state provides a civil remedy when petitioners lie.

In Massachusetts, New Jersey, Washington, and the District of Columbia, a final order can be obtained based on a mere preponderance of the evidence: anything more than a 50 percent probability that the respondent poses a ""significant"" danger. Depending on what counts as significant, this formula implies that people can lose their gun rights even if it is nearly certain that they would not have hurt themselves or others.

After the El Paso and Dayton massacres, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R–S.C.) introduced a bipartisan bill that would provide federal grants to encourage the passage and enforcement of red flag laws. ""The Second Amendment is not a suicide pact,"" Graham told Fox News, while dismissing critics of red flag laws as ""libertarians."" He likened gun confiscation orders to involuntary psychiatric treatment, saying ""that process would apply to gun ownership,"" when in fact the criteria for civil commitment are substantially stricter. Graham also promised that ""nobody's going to lose their gun unless they have their day in court,"" which is clearly not true in light of ex parte orders that can last as long as six months.

""It's a great idea on paper,"" says Dave Workman, senior editor at the Second Amendment Foundation in Bellevue, Washington. ""The problem is the execution."" In practice, he says, red flag laws mean ""you're guilty until you prove yourself innocent.""",Jacob Sullum (jsullum@reason.com),http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/reason/HitandRun/~3/8pSIpOLKKB8/,2019-10-06 10:00:13+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
237058,"hitandrun--2019-11-21--With This Forfeiture Trick, Innocent Owners Lose Even When They Win",11/21/2019,hitandrun,"With This Forfeiture Trick, Innocent Owners Lose Even When They Win","Critics of civil forfeiture, the system of legalized theft that allows law enforcement agencies to seize people's property by alleging it is connected to criminal activity, often focus on the burden of proof the government faces when owners try to recover their assets. While those standards are obviously important, nearly nine out of 10 federal forfeiture cases never make it to court, largely because mounting a challenge often costs more than the property is worth. And while the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act (CAFRA) allows owners who win in court to recover ""reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs,"" prosecutors can defeat that safeguard by dragging out cases and then dropping them before a judge decides whether forfeiture is legally justified.

In the meantime, desperate owners may decide to let the government keep some of their property, even when they are completely innocent. From the government's perspective, there is no downside. ""By gaming the system and denying property owners a 'win' in court,"" says Institute for Justice (I.J.) senior attorney Dan Alban, ""federal prosecutors have found a way to short-circuit judicial oversight of their activities, while at the same time preserving their ability to continue to abuse Americans' property rights.""

I.J. is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to consider a case that takes aim at such sneaky tactics, arguing that an owner can ""substantially prevail"" in a forfeiture battle, as required by the CAFRA provision dealing with attorney fees, even if the government returns the property before it officially loses in court. ""The threat of paying attorneys' fees is a critical check on government abuse,"" observes Justin Pearson, another I.J. senior attorney. ""Otherwise, there is no disincentive to stop prosecutors from filing frivolous civil forfeitures against property belonging to innocent owners.""

The I.J. case involves Miladis Salgado, a Florida woman whose home was searched in 2015 based on a tip that her estranged husband was a drug dealer. Although that tip proved to be unfounded, Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents found $15,000 in cash that belonged to Salgado, which they seized. Salgado hired a lawyer to challenge the forfeiture on a contingency fee basis, agreeing to pay a third of any money she recovered.

The case dragged on for two years, and the government dropped it just as a federal judge was about to rule on Salgado's motion for summary judgment. Since the DEA admitted it had no evidence implicating Salgado in criminal activity, it seems likely that she would have prevailed, which explains why the government suddenly agreed to return her money. But now instead of her original $15,000, she had only $10,000, since she had to pay her lawyer.

When Salgado asked the court to make the government cover that cost, U.S. District Judge Darrin Gayles ruled that she was not entitled to attorney fees under CAFRA, since the case had been dismissed without prejudice, meaning it theoretically could be refiled. ""A dismissal without prejudice cannot trigger the statutory entitlement,"" he concluded, ""because such a dismissal lacks the necessary 'material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties' with a corresponding 'judicial imprimatur on the change.'"" Last July the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld that decision.

The Institute for Justice is now asking the Supreme Court to resolve two questions: When does an owner ""substantially prevail"" in a forfeiture challenge, triggering an award of attorney fees, and does a judge have the discretion to dismiss forfeiture claims without prejudice when ""the court has ordered the United States to return the seized money and the lawsuit will never be refiled""?

The institute's petition argues that the 11th Circuit erred by reading the word substantially out of CAFRA, limiting its analysis to the question of whether Salgado was the ""prevailing party."" I.J. notes that the district court not only ordered the government to return Salgado's money but said the government would be on the hook for her legal fees if it decided to refile the case. ""Ms. Salgado substantially prevailed,"" I.J. says. ""She obtained the full return of her money, and she even obtained a court order inhibiting the United States from refiling the civil forfeiture lawsuit.""

To conclude otherwise, the petition says, would deprive innocent owners of the protection CAFRA was supposed to provide. According to the House report on the bill, Congress wanted to ""give owners innocent of any wrongdoing the means to recover their property and make themselves whole after wrongful government seizures."" An innocent owner who loses a third of her property to legal fees imposed on her by a wrongful forfeiture action plainly has not been ""made whole.""

The House report on CAFRA also noted that ""many civil seizures are not challenged"" because of the costs owners must pay on ""the arduous path one must journey"" to contest them, ""often without the benefit of counsel, and perhaps without any money left after the seizure with which to fight the battle."" If owners are forced to pay those costs even when the government effectively concedes their innocence, the remedy provided by CAFRA has been nullified.

I.J. also wants the Supreme Court to resolve a circuit split on the question of whether judges may dismiss forfeiture claims without prejudice in cases like this. Disagreement on that point among federal appeals courts, it says, has ""resulted in widely divergent outcomes in district courts across the country."" The position endorsed by the 11th Circuit in Salgado's case ""presents a catch-22"" for victims of forfeiture abuse, the petition says: ""In order for an innocent owner to be awarded attorneys' fees under CAFRA, the government's case against the money or property cannot be dismissed without prejudice. But the innocent owner cannot prevent the case from being dismissed without prejudice because, in these circuits, their right to be awarded attorneys' fees has not yet vested.""

In this case, as in its many other challenges to forfeiture abuse, I.J. is calling attention to the way the system works in practice, showing that even well-intended safeguards can be defeated by coercive tactics that deprive innocent people of their property. ""Seizing someone's property and forcing them to hire an attorney for two years to get it back has real costs,"" Pearson says. ""The government can't take your property, keep it for years, and then suddenly give it back and pretend like nothing happened.""

So far, of course, the government can do exactly that. The Supreme Court can put a stop to it by taking up this case.",Jacob Sullum (jsullum@reason.com),http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/reason/HitandRun/~3/Yd46Ioe6qYI/,2019-11-21T17:55:50Z,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
237350,hitandrun--2019-12-12--An Unreliable Jailhouse Informant May Have Sent an Innocent Florida Man to Death Row,12/12/2019,hitandrun,An Unreliable Jailhouse Informant May Have Sent an Innocent Florida Man to Death Row,"James Dailey has long maintained that he didn't murder Shelly Boggio in 1985. No physical evidence ties him to the case, and there's good reason to think the man who originally pointed the finger at Dailey is the actual killer. A story by Pamela Colloff, published by ProPublica and The New York Times, shows how an unreliable jailhouse informant may have doomed an innocent man to the execution chamber in Florida.

On May 6, 1985, Boggio's nude body was found floating in a Pinellas County waterway; she had been stabbed several times. Dailey and his roommate, Jack Pearcy, became subjects of interest in the case. Pearcy has a history of violence against women. On the last day of her life, Pearcy took Boggio to a bar near the Intracoastal Waterway after spending an afternoon drinking and smoking weed at his apartment.

Though he admitted to stabbing Boggio at least once and provided intimate details of the crime, Pearcy insisted that Dailey was the actual murderer. Pearcy claimed that Dailey joined the pair before they reached the water that night.

Pearcy, who is serving life in prison, has since confessed four times that he was solely responsible for Boggio's death. He also told two other inmates that Dailey was innocent. Pearcy owned a knife consistent with the stab wounds, knew where investigators could find its sheath, and was the only person who eyewitnesses saw with Boggio the night she was murdered.

Yet Dailey's fate was sealed by three jailhouse informants, including one Paul Skalnik. Skalnik was one of the county's most prolific jailhouse informants, testifying in at least 37 cases. Many of those trials ended in convictions or plea deals; four ended with death sentences. Though he spent his days in protective custody, he told investigators that he managed to obtain a confession from Dailey while passing by his cell.

Pearcy refused to testify against Dailey in court, so Skalnik took the stand, testifying that Dailey had confessed to the murder while asking for legal advice. Detective John Halliday vouched for Skalnik because they had worked together before.

Jailhouse informants have an incentive to tell prosecutors what they want to hear, since their cooperation could help with their own cases. After the two other inmates claimed that they heard Dailey admit to the murder, a third later said that they concocted their stories in an effort to get their own sentences reduced. (They succeeded.) The third inmate also said police showed him news clippings of the crime in hopes that he would testify against Dailey. He refused.

Though Skalnik assured the jury that he was receiving nothing for his testimony, he was released five days after Dailey was sentenced to death.

After serving a sentence for grand theft, Skalnik was paroled in March 1985. He quickly violated his parole with various financial cons and returned to jail. Though he was identified as a flight risk, a parole violator, and was called a ""danger to society"" by his parole officer, a Florida Parole and Probation Commission memo said he was released due to his ""cooperation with the State Attorney's Office in the first-degree murder trial."" Public records show several other instances where Skalnik received benefits for his help in other trials despite assessments that he was a ""con artist of the highest degree."" Prosecutors once dismissed a 1982 charge for lewd and lascivious conduct involving a 12-year-old girl. Neither those charges nor their dismissals were mentioned to the jury in Dailey's case.

There are other reasons to question Skalnik's honesty. When Colloff interviewed him, he claimed that he'd been shot down in Laos during the Vietnam War. After obtaining his military records, Colloff found that Skalnik was not on combat duty during Vietnam, and did not serve overseas at all.

Dailey was set to die on November 7, but U.S. District Judge William Jung temporarily stayed his execution in October to give lawyers more time to present their case. Yesterday Jung rejected the new appeals.

Dailey's attorney, Josh Dubin, tells Reason he is asking Gov. Ron DeSantis to grant a clemency hearing to argue the prisoner's innocence. A coalition of local supporters—including the Innocence Project of Florida, the Catholic Diocese of St. Augustine, a former prosecutor, and a collection of Florida death row exonerees—is also asking the state to exonerate Dailey before it's too late.",Zuri Davis (zuri.davis@reason.com),http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/reason/HitandRun/~3/9qvOiKgQipc/,2019-12-12T19:20:11Z,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

“Those in support of abolishing the death penalty point to the possibility of an innocent person being executed… The innocent can take solace in knowing that a unanimous jury of 12 citizens must render the death verdict after an exhaustive trial where the accused murderer is represented by two highly competent attorneys and overseen by an independent judge who ensures a fair trial.”

If I had a son who was executed for a murder he didn’t commit and posthumously proven innocent, I would be tempted to avenge his wrongful death (actually murder) through vigilante justice.

332798,"nationalreview--2019-10-14--When Cops Create Their Own Risk, Innocent People Die for Their Mistakes",10/14/2019,nationalreview,"When Cops Create Their Own Risk, Innocent People Die for Their Mistakes","And when the mistake is theirs, they cannot use the ‘split second’ defense.

The video is puzzling and shocking. After receiving a call to a non-emergency number requesting that police check on a neighbor’s house that had its doors open and its lights on, police approach silently. They look into an open door and into a brightly lit room, but they don’t say anything. They then creep around the house, moving from light to dark. They use a flashlight. They keep moving around the edges of the house.

Suddenly, in a mere moment, one of them spots movement in a window. The officer yells for the shadowy figure to put up her hands and then immediately fires a shot. Atatiana Jefferson was dead. She was 28 years old. According to her family’s lawyer, she was playing video games with her young nephew when they heard “rustling” outside and “saw flashlights.” There was a gun in the house, but there’s no indication (yet) that she was holding it in her hand.

But what if she was? Does a homeowner not have a right to investigate someone lurking on her property? Can she not arm herself at 2:30 a.m. when she hears a strange sound in the darkness?

I’ve been looking closely at the police-shooting issue for many years, and I’m noticing a trend in many of the worst and most controversial shootings. The police make mistakes that heighten their own sense of danger, and then they “resolve” their own error by opening fire.

The examples are easy to find. The worst and most recent is that of Dallas officer Amber Guyger, who made the dreadful mistake of entering the wrong house and then immediately dealt with the perceived “threat” by shooting the innocent man inside.

But Guyger is hardly the only offender. Who can forget the terrible shooting of Philando Castile, gunned down as he tried to comply with conflicting commands from an obviously panicked officer — the officer told Castile to hand over his license and proof of insurance, but also to not reach for his gun. He shot Castile to death even as Castile was calmly telling him that he wasn’t reaching for his gun.

Then there’s the extraordinarily gut-wrenching video of a cop killing Daniel Shaver as he sobbed and begged for his life. The officer’s instructions were utterly incomprehensible. He told Shaver to not put his hands down for any reason. He also told him to crawl down the hall..

No one should forget Andrew Scott. Police seeking a suspect showed up at the wrong house (without a warrant), did not turn on their lights, did not identify themselves as police, and pounded violently on the door late at night. When Scott answered his own door with a firearm in his hand, he was instantly shot dead.

It wasn’t until the tragic death of Willie McCoy that the trend truly became obvious. McCoy was sleeping in his car, blocking a drive-through window, with a gun in his lap. When he began to move, cops clustered around his car started screaming at him so loudly that the transcript of the video has to explain that the shouts weren’t gunshots. Then, within three seconds, the officers riddled him with bullets. They startled him awake, and then killed him.

Would Atatiana Jefferson still be alive if the cops had parked in front of her house and clearly identified themselves by shouting into the open door? Would they still be alive had they not lurked around a person’s home without permission — exactly like a person who was trespassing, perhaps with malign intent?

There is absolutely no question that police have a difficult job. There is no question that even routine encounters and wellness checks can — on rare occasions — escalate to deadly violence. But there is also no question that time and again police have enhanced the risk to the public through their own mistakes. Poor tactics can yield terrible results, and police should not be able to use the “split-second decision” defense when they created the crisis.

There is no greater violation of liberty than the loss of your own life in your own home at the hands of misguided, panicky, or poorly trained agents of the state. Absent compelling evidence not yet revealed to the public, it appears that the man who killed Atatiana Jefferson committed a criminal act. He deserves to face criminal justice.",David French,https://www.nationalreview.com/2019/10/when-cops-create-their-own-risk-innocent-people-die-for-their-mistakes/,"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 20:21:55 +0000","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
363068,newyorker--2019-01-14--Study Most Innocent People Need to Hire Thirty-Five Lawyers at Some Point,1/14/2019,newyorker,Study: Most Innocent People Need to Hire Thirty-Five Lawyers at Some Point,"WASHINGTON (The Borowitz Report)—Most people who are innocent of any crimes will still need to hire thirty-five lawyers at some point, a new study shows.

According to the study, commissioned by the University of Minnesota Law School, thirty-five is the “bare minimum” number of lawyers that an innocent person should have on retainer in the event that he or she becomes the subject of an entirely unjustified criminal investigation.

“We found that many innocent people are going through life without taking the basic precaution of hiring thirty-five lawyers,” Professor Davis Logsdon, who supervised the study, said. “They are flirting with disaster.”

“An innocent person who has absolutely nothing to hide should do everything in his or her power to avoid answering questions from investigators,” he said. “Thirty-five lawyers can really help you do that.”

Additionally, Logsdon noted, hiring nearly three dozen lawyers is invaluable because of the powerful statement it makes. “Nothing says ‘I’m innocent’ like hiring thirty-five lawyers,” he said.

Although some innocent people may balk at the unwieldy number of lawyers that the study recommends, Logsdon emphasized that thirty-five lawyers provide necessary protection against unforeseen legal complications. “If, for example, one of your lawyers goes to prison, you will still have thirty-four,” he said.

Logsdon acknowledged that, although every innocent person should definitely hire thirty-five lawyers, such legal help does not come cheap. “Legal bills for thirty-five lawyers can be very expensive, unless you’re a person who doesn’t pay his bills,” he said.",Andy Borowitz,https://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/study-most-innocent-people-need-to-hire-thirty-five-lawyers-at-some-point,2019-01-14 12:46:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
424690,powerlineblog--2019-05-04--Kamala Harris feels awful about role in keeping apparently innocent man on death row,5/4/2019,powerlineblog,Kamala Harris feels “awful” about role in keeping apparently innocent man on death row,"Advocates of abolishing the death penalty claim that innocent defendants have often been executed. I’m not sure whether these advocates have been able to show that this has ever happened in modern times, but a New York Times piece by Nicholas Kristof makes a pretty good case that Kevin Cooper, a death row inmate, is innocent of the murders he was convicted of committing.

Cooper, an African-American, was convicted of murdering four people in 1983. The victims, all White, were a couple, their daughter, and a boy who was sleeping over at the couple’s house.

The couple’s son, who survived the attack, told police that the assailants were White. Hairs found in the victims’ hands seemed to confirm this account. In addition, a woman told police that her White boyfriend, a convicted murderer, was probably involved in the attack. To support this statement, she gave deputies his bloody overalls.

The deputies, says Kristof, threw away the overalls and arrested Cooper. He awaits execution.

Kristof’s lengthy article is worth reading in full. I want to focus on the role of Sen. Kamala Harris, a candidate for her Party’s presidential nomination, in the long legal battle that followed Cooper’s conviction.

Readers will recall that Harris was California’s Attorney General before she became a Senator. By the time of her involvement in the Cooper saga, DNA testing had become available for use in cases like this one. The availability of such testing is part of what gives supporters of the death penalty a high degree of confidence that the innocent won’t be executed

Harris, though, refused to allow the use of DNA testing in Cooper’s case. Indeed, according to Kristof, she “showed no interest in the case.”

It’s almost as if Black lives don’t matter to Kamala Harris.

Harris did become interested in the case after the online version of Kristof’s article appeared. She emailed him to say “I feel awful about this.”

Harris also put out a statement saying:

My career as a prosecutor was marked by fierce opposition to the death penalty while still upholding the law and a commitment to fixing a broken criminal justice system. I’ve long been an advocate for measures to improve and make our system more fair and just. As a firm believer in DNA testing, I hope the governor and the state will allow for such testing in the case of Kevin Cooper.

Harris did not explain why, as a firm believer in DNA testing, she refused to allow it in Cooper’s case. Nor did she explain why, if she’s a “fierce opponent” of the death penalty, she couldn’t be bothered to look into whether a man who faced that penalty was innocent.

As for “fixing a broken criminal justice system,” a good start would be not electing grandstanding opportunists like Harris to positions as prosecutors.

Harris should feel awful. She is a hypocrite and a disgrace.",Paul Mirengoff,https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2019/05/kamala-harris-feels-awful-about-role-in-keeping-apparently-innocent-man-on-death-row.php,2019-05-04 21:15:34+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
431490,prisonplanet--2019-07-06--Report 81 of Suspects Flagged by UK Police Facial Recognition Are Innocent,7/6/2019,prisonplanet,Report: 81% of ‘Suspects’ Flagged by UK Police Facial Recognition Are Innocent,"According to a recent report, approximately four out of five people identified by the London Metropolitan Police’s facial recognition system as possible suspects are totally innocent.

A recent report by Sky News has revealed that approximately four out of five people identified by the U.K.’s Metropolitan Police force’s as possible suspects are innocent. Researchers discovered that the system has an 81 percent inaccuracy rate which means that the vast majority of people flagged by the system are not on any wanted lists. The report states that this raises “significant concerns” about Scotland Yard’s use of the technology.

The report concludes that it is “highly possible” that the Met’s usage of the system would be found unlawful if challenged in court due to a number of technical, operational and legal issues. The Live Facial Recognition (LFR) system has been utilized since August 2016 by the Met to monitor crowds, testing the system first at Notting Hill Carnival.

Professor Pete Fussey and Dr. Daragh Murray studied the technologies accuracy rate at six of ten police trials, finding that of 42 individuals identified by the system only eight were verified to be correct. This gave the system an error rate of 81 percent. The Met has an alternative way of determining the error rate, measuring instead the number of successful and unsuccessful matches with the total number of faces processed by the system, given it an error rate of just 0.1 percent.

The Met’s deputy assistant commissioner, Duncan Ball, stated: “We are extremely disappointed with the negative and unbalanced tone of this report… We have a legal basis for this pilot period and have taken legal advice throughout.” He continued, “We believe the public would absolutely expect us to try innovative methods of crime fighting in order to make London safer.”

Paul Whelan, a retired Marine, was last heard from on December 28, according to a statement from his family, obtained by RFE/RL on January 1.

His failure to contact his family “was very much out of character for him,” the statement said.

“We are deeply concerned for his safety and well-being. His innocence is undoubted and we trust that his rights will be respected,” it added.

Whelan, 48, could face between 10 to 20 years in prison if found guilty. Russian officials did not disclose any details of his alleged involvement in espionage.

David Whelan told RFE/RL in a direct message via Twitter that his brother ""has a corporate security role"" with BorgWarner, a U.S.-based supplier of automotive parts and components.

BorgWarner said in a statement sent to RFE/RL on January 1 that Paul Whelan was the company's global security director. It added that he is responsible for overseeing the company's facilities in Auburn Hills, Michigan, ""and at other company locations around the world.""

BorgWarner has 60 manufacturing sites in 18 countries, but none of them are listed as being in Russia.

A spokeswoman for BorgWarner told RFE/RL that the company ""does not have any facilities in Russia.""

Russia's state-owned conglomerate Rostec said in 2013 that its truckmaker, KamAz, had a long record of collaboration with a subsidiary of BorgWarner known as BorgWarnerTurboSystems.

David Whelan told AP in a January 1 interview that his brother had been to Russia ""several times"" before and was helping a former U.S. Marine friend of his plan a wedding with a Russian woman.

On the morning of the day he was detained, Paul Whelan had given a tour of the Kremlin museums to a group of wedding guests, his brother said. He failed to show up for the wedding on the evening of December 28.

David Whelan said his absence led the family to fear he had been in a car accident or perhaps mugged, and were searching the Internet for news about ""dead Americans in Moscow.""

The U.S. State Department has said it knows about ""the detention of a U.S. citizen by Russian authorities"" and had been formally notified by the Russian Foreign Ministry.

The State Department said on December 31 that it had requested consular access to Paul Whelan and expected ""Russian authorities to provide it.""

David Whelan said in the AP interview that his family was told by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow that it has been unable to speak with Paul Whelan.

David Whelan said his brother had previously worked for Kelly Services, an international office-staffing company that does have offices in Moscow, and had been to Russia on business and to visit friends he had met on social-media networks.

Paul Whelan reportedly had a page on the Russian social-media site VKontakte on which he writes messages in basic Russian.

David Whelan said his brother was stationed in Iraq several times with the U.S. Marines and has been living in Novi, Michigan.

The announcement of Whelan’s detainment came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow remains open to dialogue with Washington in a New Year’s greeting to U.S. President Donald Trump.

Relations between the United States and Russia remain strained over a raft of issues including Russia’s role in wars in Syria and eastern Ukraine, its alleged meddling in elections in the United States and elsewhere, and the poisoning of a Russian double agent in Britain.

At the end of November, Trump abruptly canceled a planned meeting with Putin on the sidelines of a G20 summit in Argentina, citing tensions after Russian forces opened fire on Ukrainian Navy boats before seizing them and capturing 24 Ukrainian sailors.

The detention of Whelan comes weeks after Russian Maria Butina pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to acting as an agent for the Kremlin.

The Kremlin has denied that Butina is a Russian agent and has organized a social-media campaign to secure her release.

In the past, Russia has arrested foreigners with the aim of trading prisoners with other countries.

In his annual year-end news conference on December 20, Putin said Russia would ""not arrest innocent people simply to exchange them for someone else later on.""",,https://www.rferl.org/a/family-says-detained-u-s-citizen-innocent-was-in-moscow-for-wedding/29686723.html,2019-01-01 13:07:34+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
468034,rferl--2019-02-12--Belarusian News-Site Editor Tells Court She Is Innocent,2/12/2019,rferl,Belarusian News-Site Editor Tells Court She Is Innocent,"MINSK -- The editor of Belarus's largest independent news site, who is on trial on accusations that her publication has illegally obtained information from a state-run news agency, told the court she is innocent.

A court in the capital, Minsk, on February 12 began preliminary hearings in the case against Maryna Zolatava, editor in chief of the website Tut.by.

Dozens of people who came to the trial greeted Zolatava with applauds and supporting chants as she entered the courtroom. All of the courtroom's 170 seats were filled.

As the hearing started, Zolatava rejected all the charges.

""I have not committed any of the crimes I'm charged with,"" Zolatava said.

 

 The case has raised concerns by right advocates, who have warned about growing press restrictions under President Alyaksandr Lukashenka's government.

 

 In August, police officers searched Tut.by's Minsk offices, along with that of another outlet, BelaPan. Several reporters and employees, including Zolatava, were detained.

 

 The Belarusian Investigative Committee later alleged that computers from within the Tut.by and BelaPan offices used an account and password other than their own to access the paid subscriber section of BelTA, the state-run news agency. A third outlet, Belarusskaya Nauka, was also targeted.

 

 ""The crime inflicted considerable damage"" on BelTA, ""leading to the illegal procurement and use of information protected from unauthorized access, as well as to the erosion of the enterprise’s business reputation,"" the committee charged.

 

 In all, 15 people faced charges. However, all except for Zolatava had charges dropped after paying administrative fines and damages.

 

 Zolatava, meanwhile, was hit with new charges of ""official inaction,"" a charge comparable to negligence.

 

 She has denied the allegations.

 

 Independent Belarusian media have faced severe restrictions for years under Lukashenka's authoritarian government.

 

 In June, lawmakers passed controversial amendments to the country's media laws, which media advocates warned would likely to lead to further censorship of the press.

 

 A month later, a journalist was sentenced to four years of restricted movement and forced labor after being convicted of assaulting two police officers. The reporter, Dzmitry Halko, said the case against him was retribution for his critical stance against Lukashenka.

 

 Other Belarusian journalists and bloggers have been harassed and detained, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.",,https://www.rferl.org/a/belarus-news-editor-trial/29764982.html,2019-02-12 04:59:22+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
480489,shareblue--2019-05-17--GOP takes money from accused rapist because he says hes innocent,5/17/2019,shareblue,GOP takes money from accused rapist because he says he's innocent,"The Republican Party is happily accepting money from an accused rapist who calls Trump his ""great friend.""

The Republican National Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee — two of the main groups that seek to get Republicans elected at the federal level — accepted $400,000 in campaign contributions from Steve Wynn, the disgraced casino magnate accused of sexual assault and rape by multiple women, Politico reported Friday.

The cash came from Steve Wynn, who was forced to resign from his role as finance chair at the RNC after the allegations about sexual assault and rape came out. Wynn was also forced to step down as chairman of his casino empire.

That's because the allegations against Wynn are disturbing and graphic. He's accused of forcing one employee at his Las Vegas casino to have sex — and ended up settling with the female accuser for $7.5 million, according to a report from the Wall Street Journal.

Another employee at his Las Vegas casino, a female massage therapist, said Wynn would expose himself during massages and once forced her to masturbate him to climax — something she felt pressured to do because he was her boss and she feared being fired for not accepting his demands.

The RNC faced pressure at the time the allegations were first made public to return the donations Wynn had made to the committee, but refused.

Now, however, they are accepting hundreds of thousands more from Wynn.

And the reasoning from RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel is about as mealy mouthed as it gets.

""While we must take any allegations like these seriously, everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence and due process. Over the last year and a half, multiple investigations into the allegations against Steve Wynn have concluded. Throughout this entire process, Steve has repeatedly and unequivocally denied wrongdoing, and he has not been charged with or found guilty of any crimes,"" McDaniel said in a statement to Politico. ""At this point, there is no reason for refusing his support.""

Of course, this is the same McDaniel who went on a crusade against Democrats who accepted money from Harvey Weinstein, the film mogul who was also accused of sexual assault and rape. Like Wynn, Weinstein has also not been found guilty of the crimes he's accused of committing.

Republicans accepting men accused of sexual assault and rape shouldn't surprise anyone, however.

Trump is, after all, the leader of the GOP, and he's been accused of sexual assault by nearly two dozen women, as well as openly admitted to grabbing women's genitals without consent.

Last month, Wynn greeted Trump on the tarmac in Las Vegas when Trump flew there for a rally.

It's no wonder women have fled the GOP. This is not a party that values or supports women.

495083,sottnet--2019-01-17--Cop charged for stomping innocent man as K9 chewed off hunks of flesh,1/17/2019,sottnet,Cop charged for stomping innocent man as K9 chewed off 'hunks of flesh',"On the night of June 24, 2016, Frank Baker - an innocent man - 'fit the description' of a 'black man' in the area, so he was attacked by police and their K9.On Wednesday, officer Brett Palkowitsch, 31, was charged with one count of deprivation of rights for kicking the innocent man while a K9 tore him apart, literally.said a news release from the Minneapolis' FBI office, which investigated the case.At the time of the incident,Also at the scene that fateful night was officer Tony Spencer - whose dashcam recorded the violent assault on Baker - and who could not keep silent about what he saw.That night, Spencer and his partner responded to a call, which ended up being fake, about a man with dreadlocks wearing a white t-shirt and armed with a gun.When they arrived on the scene, Spencer and his partner saw Baker and realized he did not look like a suspect.""There are about 50 people who would have matched that description that night,"" Spencer said of Baker. ""He is not acting agitated. To me, he does not appear to be engaged in a fight. He did not appear to have run from a fight ... so we continue to roll through.""However, just after they passed Baker, two less experienced and far more violent cops showed up, pulled out their guns, and unleashed a dog.Because police said Baker was slow to respond when showing his hands, officer Brian Ficcandenti let loose the K9, 'Falco.'""I'm thinking he (Ficcadenti) saw something we didn't see or missed and is now performing a felony-style stop,"" Spencer recalled. ""As I turn the car and see the dog pulling out this man from the cars, I recognize it's (Baker). I can clearly see there's nothing in his hand as he comes between the cars.""The dashcam then captured the following beat down - after Baker had been mauled.Baker's legs were so severely injured during the attack that he spent weeks in the hospital recovering. He also suffered several broken ribs and collapsed lungs as well.According to his attorney Robert Bennett, the dog tore ""hunks of flesh"" as its teeth bit ""down to the bone"" of Baker's legs.After watching his fellow officers do this to an innocent person, Spencer could no longer stand it and did what a good cop should do. He crossed the thin blue line and testified against the officers who nearly killed an innocent man. It is highly likely that without Spencer's testimony, Palkowitsch would not be facing any charges. After all, he was still hired back, even after Spencer blew the whistle.""It was very difficult because it was something I had been programmed throughout my career to never do,"" Spencer, told Ruben Rosario from Twin Cities at the time.""But I decided that the right thing to do was tell Mr. Baker's story,"" he added as he looked away momentarily, tears starting to form in his eyes, explained Rosario. ""I owed it to him. How do you explain to that guy what happened to him was justified?""Spencer, who felt horrible after watching his fellow officers do this to an innocent man, visited Baker in the hospital.""He had these big tears in his eyes,"" Spencer noticed. ""He was still having trouble breathing. And then he tells me:""We are the department that brought (cop killer) Guy Harvey Baker to jail alive,"" Spencer said. ""That's what the community expects of us. The younger cops don't understand the legacy of the department. In our darkest hour on our worst day, we brought in that guy alive. And he did not have seven broken ribs and two collapsed lungs, did he? And he killed two of our cops.""Because of Spencer's testimony, which was described as the entire department against him and his partner, Baker received the largest settlement for police misconduct in the history of St. Paul, $2 million.Officer Spencer is the epitome of a good cop as he was unafraid of pointing out the crimes of his fellow cops against an innocent member of society - whom they ostensibly protect.However, that good cop is now gone, retiring shortly after this incident, and he has since been replaced, as he stated above, by ""younger cops [who] don't understand the legacy of the department"" who are more prone to destroy first and attempt to justify later.Below is a video showing the type of legacy the new cops intend to leave for the St. Paul police department - and it is terrifying.",,https://www.sott.net/article/405174-Cop-charged-for-stomping-innocent-man-as-K9-chewed-off-hunks-of-flesh,2019-01-17 20:05:39+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But in the back of his mind, he knew the entire time that he was going to plant meth on her and have her thrown in a cage-an insidious move indeed.

A single cop framed dozens of innocent people and once a state attorney found the body camera footage from the arrests, the victims were vindicated.Dozens of innocent people who were rotting in jail have been freed and their charges erased after the corrupt cop who put them there was. Jackson County Sheriff's Deputy Zachary Wester has since been fired and a slew of lawsuits are now rolling in.Wester's fall from law enforcement grace and theare due largely in part to the diligence of a single person, assistant state attorney at the 14th Judicial Circuit, Christina Pumphrey.Pumphrey's job as assistant state attorney included reviewing evidence before moving forward with charges against individuals. When she began reviewing cases, she found something very peculiar.""This is an exaggeration, but it felt like his (Wester's) name was on half the cases,"" Pumphrey told The Appeal. When Pumphrey began watching the body camera footage from Wester's arrests, she found something even more disturbing. Many times,. Also, his written affidavits did not match what she watched in the videos. But that wasn't the most telling aspect of all these videos.While it is no question that folks will claim that drugs found on them or in their possession ""aren't their's"" and ""they don't know how that got there,"" nearly all of Wester's cases had this. The videos showed that people were utterly shocked when Wester claimed to have found drugs in their vehicles. While a single person may have been lying,Although she reviewed multiple videos, Pumphrey never saw the actual act of Wester planting drugs or otherwise hiding them. However, all that changed when Wester pulled over Teresa Odom in February of 2018.In that video, Wester pulls Odom over, claiming her tail lights aren't working. However, it would later be revealed that her tail lights were, in fact, working fine and Wester had targeted her to frame her.In the video,After threatening to have a K-9 come search her car, Wester tells Odom that she can avoid the K-9 if she just lets him search her truck himself - a huge mistake.As the body camera shows, Wester opens the door to Odom's truck and is cupping a small baggie with a white powder in it.Wester would plant the substance under a red towel in her truck and then pretend to find it later.After Pumphrey began to raise red flags in her department pointing out videos like Odom's, she saysAs The Appeal reports:Apparently, it wasn't just Wester who had an interest in locking up innocent people.Pumphrey said. ""When it was ignorance it was one thing, but as soon as we know there are innocent people sitting in jail and we don't drop the charges, we're as guilty as he is.""Although Wester was fired after Pumphrey exposed him,claiming they are still looking into it.Also, although these 119 people were vindicated, and a possible 30 more could be, they still face challenges from being framed.""People still had consequences. It wasn't like this was just all erased,"" Pumphrey said. Dropped charges still remain on a person's criminal record. And ""even though the charges got dropped. Or you've got people who have to spend money on supervision fees; they have to spend money paying for their own urine analysis test; they've done community service hours; they paid cost of bond - like $1,500. ...

In the land of the free, if police feel that your window tint is too dark, they will claim the right to extort money from you. If you resist this extortion, police will claim the right to kidnap or kill you. Unfortunately, in the land of the free, these instances happen so frequently that they are often caught on video too. As the following incident illustrates, fearful cops whose only tool is the escalation of violence, will not hesitate to resort to deadly force over a stop for window tint.A video was submitted to the Free Thought Project this week showingIn California, police officers who target people for extortion over window tint have the option of issuing those folks a fix-it ticket. These tickets give the owner of the vehicle a certain time frame in which to correct the supposed violation. Typically, you pay a smaller fee and then prove that you ""fixed"" the problem, like remove the window tint or fix a broken taillight.Ornelas' fix-it time frame had not yet expired and he was still within the law. This did not matter to these officers though, who just knew they had nabbed themselves a criminal.Police then told Ornelas that he had a missing front license plate, which Ornelas already had a fix it ticket for as well. They then told him they saw him recklessly driving. However, once again, Ornelas had his entire drive recorded on the same dash camera that was recording cops, proving he did no such thing.During the stop, multiple officers continued to press this innocent man until another officer on a power trip approached the car. At this point, Ornelas asked her if this was ""Nazi Germany"" as his harassment was not keeping anyone safe and akin to a ""papers please"" shakedown.This comment seemed to push the officer over the top. She then asked Ornelas if he had any weapons and in California, you are legally required to tell police where it is when they ask. Ornelas told officers that he had a legally registered gun in his trunk and all hell broke loose.The frightened cop then pulled out a gun and held it to Ornelas' head. Naturally, this frightened the innocent man, who likely thought he was about to be killed. Ornelas cooperated with every single one of the officers' command as he was dragged from the vehicle.""This is exactly why I wanted a supervisor,"" Ornelas says as he's being handcuffed at gunpoint over window tint.""Stop resisting,"" the female cop says when it is clearly evident from the video that no such resisting is happening.When Ornelas asked once more why they were detaining him, once more, the officer could not give him a straight answer and said, ""when we pulled you over, you were acting nervous.""Ornelas was issued several citations during this stop, all of which he fought in court. This stop happened in November of 2018, but Ornelas just went to court for it this month. And, because he filmed the entire interaction, he won. He beat all the charges, which is why he decided to release the video below.Below is a video showing how police extortion for window tint can and will lead to your life being threatened by those sworn to uphold the Constitution.The Free Thought Project reached out to the Sacramento police department for a statement on this incident and we have not yet received a response.",,https://www.sott.net/article/419359-Cops-put-a-gun-to-innocent-mans-head-over-window-tint-stop,2019-08-28 10:28:08+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
561665,tass--2019-02-18--Kremlin on Baring Vostok founders arrest Innocent until proven guilty in a court of law,2/18/2019,tass,Kremlin on Baring Vostok founder’s arrest: Innocent until proven guilty in a court of law,"MOSCOW, February 18. /TASS/. Founder of the Baring Vostok equity firm, Michael
Calvey, who was detained on February 16 on suspicion of fraud, cannot be
considered guilty on any charges until a court has handed down a verdict,
Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday.

""We know that law enforcement agencies have questions for Michael Calvey, and
we know that the court decided to detain him. Right now, we can say that he
cannot be considered guilty on any charges, because there was no legal trial
and he can only be convicted by a court’s verdict,"" the spokesman emphasized.

When asked if President Vladimir Putin discussed the case with anyone, in
particular Russian businessmen, who said they were ready to vouch for Calvey,
Peskov said: ""No, this situation has nothing to do and should not have nothing
to do with the agenda of the head of the state. This issue concerns the
investigative agencies first and foremost. It may also partially concern the
fiscal authorities since this is a really large investor in our economy.""

Peskov stayed muted on how the court’s decision regarding Calvey complies with
Putin’s earlier statement that the authorities should choose alternative
measures to arrest with regard to the businessmen under investigation.

""I cannot comment on the court’s decision in any way,"" he stressed.

According to him, the Kremlin did not know when the decision to detain Calvey
was made, because this ruling ""was made not inside the administration, but
within special departments, and the president was informed about it according
to the established procedure after reports in the media were published.""

On a similar note, Peskov stressed that it would be incorrect to compare
Calvey’s case with the detention of Rauf Arashukov, a senator from Karachay-
Cherkessia, who is facing charges of ordering two murders and organizing a
criminal gang. The Kremlin official said that in Calvey’s case, the court is
dealing with a foreign investor and a citizen of another country.

## Calvey’s arrest

On February 16, Moscow’s Basmanny Court ruled to arrest the founder of Baring
Vostok and co-owner of Vostochny Bank Michael Calvey for two months on
suspicion of embezzling 2.5 bln rubles ($37.5 mln). That said, Calvey’s
lawyers are going to challenge the ruling.

Baring Vostok is one of the largest private equity firms focusing on Russia
and the CIS with $3.7 bln in capital. Since 1994, the fund has poured more
than $2.4 bln of investments into 70 projects in the areas of financial
services, oil and gas, telecommunications and media, and into the consumer
sector.

Baring Vostok’s projects include CTC Media, Yandex, Avito, Ozon, ER-Telecom,
1C, and Novomet.

622008,thedailymirror--2019-01-10--Payment giant PayPal is trying to make an innocent customer pay for the actions of online fraudsters,1/10/2019,thedailymirror,Payment giant PayPal is trying to make an innocent customer pay for the actions of online fraudsters,"According to PayPal, it’s doing the decent thing by ­refunding a customer who was the victim of an online fraud.

Trouble is, it’s doing this by trying to claw back money from another innocent victim of the same fraud.

The nightmare for Rosie Pritchard began with what appeared to be a Facebook message from a family friend asking for a favour: “I sold some things online and my account is currently limited. Can you receive a payment, withdraw it and then bank transfer to me?”

Rosie kindly agreed to help and £420 then appeared in her PayPal account, paid by someone called Nigel Stokes, and Rosie transferred it as requested.

Unfortunately, she sent it to crooks who had compromised the friend’s Facebook page as well as the PayPal account of Nigel Stokes.

When Nigel realised that the money had been stolen from his account, he complained to PayPal, who refunded him.

Then the payment giant debited the money from Rosie’s account and, because her balance was zero, that left her £420 in the red.

“I’m a single mum who simply doesn’t have this sort of money and I now face having to pay for the crimes of a scammer and PayPal’s insecure payment system,” said Rosie, from Leatherhead in Surrey.

PayPal told Rosie, “You used those funds”, which seems to be unreasonably implying that she got some sort of benefit from this fraud.

When she refused to repay the money, it emailed her: “This is an urgent matter that requires your immediate attention to ensure continued ­availability of your PayPal account to avoid ­additional collection efforts.”

Sure enough, it put debt collectors Wescot Credit Services on to her.

PayPal confirmed to me that it had refunded Mr Stokes “after a thorough investigation”, but blamed Rosie for “removing the money from the PayPal network” when she inadvertently forwarded it to crooks.

It insisted: “We are working with Ms Pritchard to find a way of helping her manage this debt” – missing the point that Rosie does not believe it is her debt at all.

I tried explaining to PayPal that she received the money in good faith and no longer has it, thanks to the actions of scammers, and is only in this position because Mr Stokes’ account had somehow been compromised.

“Should she carry full, or even any, responsibility for what has happened?” I asked.

PayPal responded by still blaming Rosie, saying: “We go to great lengths to protect our customers, but there are still some basic precautions we should all take to avoid scams.”

I persisted, in a series of emails with PayPal, telling them: “This happened because of a ­compromised account. Shouldn’t PayPal take responsibility for this?”

They wouldn’t budge, saying: “We have taken responsibility for that unauthorised payment by returning the funds to the sender.

“While Ms Pritchard was not responsible for receiving the ­unauthorised payment, she is responsible for sending the money to (presumably) the fraudster’s bank account.”

Strangely, Rosie has received a letter from the debt collectors saying they are no longer chasing the money, but she’s had no further word from PayPal.

Last summer, the Financial Ombudsman Service said that banks too often claimed that frauds were the fault of customers.

“The evolution of criminals’ methods, in particular, sophisticated use of technology and manipulative ‘social engineering’, means it’s an increasingly difficult case to make,” said Caroline Wayman, chief ombudsman. Maybe that should apply to payment facilities like PayPal as well as banks.",Andrew Penman,https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/payment-giant-paypal-trying-make-13835175,2019-01-10 07:13:30+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
634536,thedailymirror--2019-06-19--Woman falsely accused innocent cabbie of rape after she lost phone on night out,6/19/2019,thedailymirror,Woman 'falsely accused innocent cabbie of rape after she lost phone on night out',"A young woman falsely accused an innocent taxi driver of rape after she lost her mobile phone and became separated from her friends during a drunken night out, a court heard today.

Laura Hood, 27, wrongly told police the driver had stopped his cab at the side of the road and sexually assaulted her in the back seat whilst he was giving her a lift home at the end of the evening, it was said.

Detectives investigated Hood's claims during which they arrested Haroon Yousaf and also the driver of a different taxi with a similar number plate.

Mr Yousaf, 29, who was detained in front of colleagues at a cab rank spent a total 20 hours in custody and had to give intimate samples before he was released without charge and exonerated of any wrongdoing.

It was claimed police suspected he had been falsely accused when he gave details of a tracking device linked to the black cab which showed the vehicle had been driven straight to Hood's home in Stockport, Greater Manchester without stopping.

There was also no evidence of physical contact between them.

The other suspect was also cleared of any wrongdoing and Hood was subsequently charged with faking her account.

Details emerged at Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, as she denied perverting the course of justice.

""If it were not for that tracker data Mr Yousaf may have found himself on trial for rape because the defendant made up a story about him,"" said Geoff Whelan prosecuting.

""Perhaps only the defendant knows why she would fabricate such an allegation, but make it up she did. A false allegation is a very serious matter.

""She accepts that she was in Mr Yousaf's taxi and she accepts that he drove her home. She further accepts that Mr Yousaf did not rape her - but says, somehow that she honestly believed she was raped whilst in that taxi.""

The incident occurred on January 7 2017 after Hood, from Stockport had been out with friends at Revolution bar at the Deansgate Locks complex in Manchester city centre.

Mr Yousaf had just dropped off a fare when Hood got into his vehicle at 1.10am and asked to be taken home.

Mr Whelan added: ""She appeared to be drunk as she did so and said she just wanted to go home as she had lost her friends and her mobile phone. She said she had £20 and asked how much it was going to be.

Mr Yousaf gave her an estimate of about £25 and she asked to be taken to a bank.

""Mr Yousaf drove her to a Tesco Express where CCTV footage showed the taxi stopping there at 1.22am with the defendant getting out to use the cash machine.

""By 1.23am the taxi was driving off again and Mr Yousaf followed the directions on his satnav and took her straight home and reached the destination.

""The fare was around £26, and the defendant gave him £30 and said ""keep the change"" and paid the money through the slot in the middle of all black cab taxis.

""Mr Yousaf then thanked her then turned around and drove back to town. That 26 minute journey was in all respects entirely unremarkable.

""But at 1.40 when the defendant got home, it seems she was quite noisy and her mother asking if she was ok. The defendant then went upstairs to her mother and stepfather's bedroom where she was sobbing uncontrollably as she came into the room.

""Her mother asked her what was wrong and she had lost her phone. She was crying, shaking and unable to breathe and then said that she had been raped.

""Her stepfather phoned the police and the defendant said she had lost her phone in Revolution and had started to panic and asked a taxi driver take her to Stockport.

""She said that they were going down the road and thought it was strange because he turned left when they live on the right.

""She said that he stopped and the driver got in the back of the cab, grabbed her and pulled her knickers down.

""Her mother asked her why she didn't fight back and the defendant said that she was scared and that she thought that it would get worse if she tried to fight back.

""She said that he dropped her off at the end of the road and that he wouldn't drop her off outside the house. The defendant was hysterical as she was speaking to her mother.""

During her account, Hood claimed her assailant was an Asian male, aged about 58 with a thin face, no beard and no facial hair and claimed she was attacked about five minutes after stopping at the cash point.

She said that she was convinced the taxi driver was wearing a condom and said he charged her £30 for the fare.

A specially trained officer attended the family home where Hood was found to be ""extremely distraught"" and hiding under her bedding, the court heard.

She was said to be ""crying loudly and was reluctant to engage.""

In a statement to police Hood said: ""I was out with my friends in Manchester, I lost my phone, I saw people getting out of a taxi I went over to it asked how much to Stockport.

""He indicated left and I knew he was going the wrong way. He pulled up, got in the back of the taxi and I was scared - he put on a condom and pulled my knickers down to my knees kissing me all over. His hands were all over me - he then tried to have sex with me it was hurting.

I didn't say anything, I was so scared, I couldn't fight him off, I just wanted it to end.

""When he finished he just got off me and drove me back to the top of my road. He was pulling me towards him as he was having sex with me.""

Police tracked down Mr Yousaf and arrested him at a cab rank at Piccadilly railway station after checking the CCTV at the Tesco Express cashpoint.

Mr Whelan added: ""He was interviewed and was able to give a full account of his actions. He said he didn't take any detours, he didn't stop off on any side streets and he dropped her where she asked him to on her road. He denied any sexual contact with the defendant.

""He then disclosed something that would turn out to be both very important in the course of the investigation and extremely fortunate for Mr Yousaf. His taxi was fitted with a tracker device that very precisely records the movements of the vehicle.

""The investigating officer spoke to the Tracker company which holds all the data for the tracker and they confirmed that the data cannot be changed by the user, and they provided the same data.

""They were able to add that if the taxi had turned off at any 90 degree angle it would have recorded it on the tracker.""

""Mr Yousaf was released from custody at 5:32pm on 09/01/17 having spent nearly 20 hours in detention. His taxi had been forensically recovered, he was given bail to return two days later and was given a condition not to drive any taxi.

""Intimate samples were also taken from him and he suffered the indignity of being arrested in a public place in front of his colleagues. Fortunately the tracker data meant the police took no further action against Mr Yousaf.""

Detectives subsequently tried to interview Hood but at home she initially stayed in her bedroom and did not come downstairs. When she eventually agreed to speak to officers there was said to be 'little or no eye contact' and she appeared 'withdrawn.'

When confronted with the evidence of the tracker and the fact Mr Yousaf did not match the description of the suspect, she maintained she had been raped.

However, she accepts she wasn't raped by Yousaf.",mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Neil Murphy),https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/woman-falsely-accused-innocent-cabbie-16543817,2019-06-19 21:01:36+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
635548,thedailymirror--2019-06-30--Evidence which proves labourer hanged for murder 81 years ago was innocent,6/30/2019,thedailymirror,Evidence which 'proves' labourer hanged for murder 81 years ago was innocent,"It was 54 years ago that the death penalty was abolished in Britain, after public opinion turned against the ultimate form of punishment, fearing that innocent people were being sent to the gallows.

Among the cases which swung feelings was that of Derek Bentley, who was hanged for the murder of a policeman - but won a posthumous pardon in 1998, 45 years after he was hanged in 1953.

But there could now be another case to be added to the list of Brits who were executed for crimes they didn't commit.

On May 26, 1938, Robert Hoolhouse was hanged on the scaffold in Durham after being found guilty of the rape and murder of a farmer’s wife.

The labourer, who had just turned 21, died protesting his innocence right up until his last breath.

Now, however, historians who have reexamined his case have concluded that Robert’s conviction was just as dubious as others who faced the hangman’s noose and were later declared innocent.

And many now believe his death was yet another miscarriage of justice which proves that the death penalty should never be allowed to return in the UK.

It was on January 18, 1938 that the village of Wolviston, Stockton-on-Tees, was shocked by the discovery of the body of Margaret Dobson, on a cart track leading to her home at High Grange Farm.

The 67-year-old wife of farmer Henry had been raped and then “severely battered” before being stabbed twice - once in the chest and once in the neck.

The murder gripped the community, with women so scared of the vicious murdered they would not leave their homes alone and children were kept indoors.

Mr Dobson had last seen her wife and mother of their three children earlier that day when they had shared a tea of beef sandwiches at around 3pm.

She then left the house to visit her sister in Hartlepool, walking along the cart track through field to the main road to catch her bus.

She was known to wear old boots on the muddy track and then change into a smarter pair of shoes before boarding.

But on this day Mrs Dobson never made it to the main road.

When she hadn’t returned that evening, Mr Dobson waited at the bus stop until the final bus had passed by at 11pm, then walked home and had a sleepless night.

The next morning he found his wife’s body dumped in one of his fields.

The North Eastern Gazette reported: ""In the morning the animals had to be fed and work had to be done,"" reported the North Eastern Gazette.

""He started his work at about 5am. Somewhere between 7am and 8am men arrived to thrash his corn.

""At about 10am, after completing his work, he set out to make inquiries.

""He took a short cut to Wolviston through some fields. Something prompted him to look back.

""He saw something on the ground he could not understand and found the body of his wife lying on her back with head towards the farm and her feet toward the main road.""

An autopsy found that the mum-of-three died within an hour and a half of eating her tea.

As police swarmed into Wolviston and the brutal murder made newspaper front pages, Durham County Constabulary released a statement saying they wanted to speak to a man aged around 30 with the appearance of a farm worker and had been seen on a bike in the area.

The next day 20-year-old Robert William Hoolhouse was arrested and charged with Mrs Dobson’s murder.

The police had based their belief that he was the murderer on an incident that had happened three years earlier, when the Hoolhouse family had been working on the Dobsons’ farm and lived in a cottage on the land.

But following an argument Mr Dobson sacked them and thew them off the land, warning them never to return.

At the time of his arrest, police also noted marks on Robert’s face which he blamed on “a spill he had with his bicycle”, while he blamed blood on the cuffs of his shirt on a shaving cut.

His trial later heard that the scratches could have be caused as Mrs Dobson tried to defend herself.

Police also claimed the timings of Robert’s alibis on the day the farmer’s wife died didn’t tally with the statements given by people he said he had been with.

However, other evidence and the statements of other witnesses which later emerged throw more than a little doubt on his guilt.

One, Margaret Barker, said she had travelled on the same bus as Robert had taken to go to the pictures at 6pm on January 18, which would have been after Mrs Dobson had been murdered.

But she said she hadn’t noticed any scratches to his face.

Perhaps even more importantly, when Margaret had been found she was still wearing heavy wooden gloves.

The police had experimented with these gloves, trying to cause similar scratches on a volunteer's face. A secretary with long nails was unable to inflict the slightest wound.

The other witness was Doris Teale, who lived next to the Hoolhouses, and said she had seen Robert standing outside his house at the time he was supposed to be murdering Mrs Dobson.

Even more conclusive was the footprint evidence. Henry Dobson had stepped around the body and his prints were clearly seen.

Other prints, presumably from the killer, were underneath Henry's. Plaster casts of those prints had been made, but they did not match any of Robert’s footwear.

And the description of a man seen at the farm at around 5pm on the night of the murder was also at odds with the young labourer’s appearance and the clothes he had been wearing that day.

Finally, there was the fact that no semen stains were found on Robert’s clothing, despite extensive stains being found on Margaret’s.

Despite the cast contradictory evidence, though, police were convinced they had the right man.

At his trial at Leeds Assizes Court, prosecutor Mr Paley-Scott KC described the brutality of the crime.

He said: ""You will hear that whoever it was who had attacked her had battered with his fists into insensibility or, at any rate, into a state in which she, a woman 67 years of age, was no longer able to resist and had then ravished her and, one would suppose, had then decided to kill the only witness of his deed.""

Robert was found guilty by a jury after four hours and sentenced to death.

Following the conviction an appeal was launched back with a petition of 14,000 signatures, but the last-ditch attempt to save him was rejected.

Protesting his innocent to the end, Robert was hanged at Durham by famous executioner Thomas Pierrepoint.

Years later, his father reportedly made a deathbed confession that it was he who was responsible for Mrs Dobson’s murder.

But he was not seen around the murder scene and it was thought he was making an attempt to posthumously clear his son.",mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Matt Roper),https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/evidence-proves-labourer-hanged-murder-16461838,2019-06-30 09:00:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

He was appearing at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today after being arrested.

No further details of the charge against the 64-year-old have yet been released.

He arrived at Edinburgh Sheriff Court just before 2pm and made a short statement after the brief hearing.

In it, he said: ""Now that these proceedings are live it is even more important to respect the court and therefore the only thing I can say is I refute absolutely these allegations of criminality and I will defend myself to the utmost in court.""

Salmond was arrested on Wednesday after attending a police station in central Scotland.

A Police Scotland spokeswoman said: ""We can confirm that a 64-year-old man has been arrested and charged, and a report will be sent to the procurator fiscal.

""Proceedings are now live under the contempt of court act.""

The Gracey family were all staying at grandfather Joe's home after a party the day before to celebrate his granddaughter Ellie's 11th birthday.

But they were left baffled when 10 cops barged into the home, looking for people suspected of drug offences , they said.

Son Anthony, 23, was in bed when he claims officers told him to take off his boxers as part of the raid - before the entire family of six were gathered in the living room of their Glasgow home.

Joe, 60, said he told police to check paperwork ""six times"" and it was only when they called his ex wife Jacqueline, 56, by the wrong name, they realised their mistake, he said.

He said they were at the correct house number - but on the wrong street.

Grandfather-of-one Joe, lodged an official complaint with Police Scotland following the mix up, and the force said it is investigating.

Distraught retail worker, Anthony, said: ""I was fast asleep and they woke me up.

""They came upstairs and into my room. One of them said 'drop your boxers'.

""I said 'are you being serious' but they made me do it. I felt guilty but I hadn't done anything wrong.

""They made me lift up my testicles. I didn't know what to think. I've never done anything wrong in my life.

""I said I was innocent but they said they'd arrest me if I didn't shut up.

""It was really embarrassing.""

Police officers burst into Joe's home, in Easterhouse, Glasgow, at around 8.15am on July 15.

His granddaughter Ellie, 11, his sons, Anthony and Andrew, 32, and a friend, were all asleep, having celebrated the schoolgirl and ex-wife Jacqueline's birthday the day before.

Jacqueline came downstairs and noticed lots of police outside, so she opened the door and around 10 officers barged past her to get inside, he said.

""Ellie was fast asleep on the sofa and Anthony and Andrew were asleep upstairs,"" said Joe, who has a heart condition and has had two strokes.

""They said 'we have a drugs warrant' and wanted to search the house.

""Some of them went upstairs into the bedrooms everyone was woken up.

""Anthony was asked to take off his boxer shorts.

""I told them it must have been a mistake six or seven times but they didn't listen to me. I have never had anything to do with the police.

""But they just said 'we don't make mistakes'.""

Father-of-three Joe said police threatened to arrest Anthony while he argued he was innocent.

He said he has never had any dealings with police and pleaded with officers himself too.

Joe claims the whole family were made to gather in the living room, and after 15 minutes of ""sheer panic"" the penny dropped when one of the officers called Jacqueline by the wrong name.

He found a letter with his name and address on, and police realised their ""stupid"" mistake.

Joe said: ""I proved they had the wrong place with the letter.

""One of them said 'right, let's go', and they left, just like that, without an apology or anything.

""They all walked out and went to the right address.

""My granddaughter was terrified. She was inconsolable and doesn't want to come back to this house now.""

Joe said a neighbour saw police enter the same house number as him on a nearby street, moments later.

A spokesperson for the force says officers were tasked with searching a property in relation to suspected drug offences.

A Police Scotland spokesperson said: ""Police Scotland has received a complaint after officers attended the wrong address whilst executing a search warrant in the Easterhouse area of Glasgow.

""Enquiries are ongoing and we are unable to comment further.""",reporters@dailyrecord.co.uk (Jack Longstaff),https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/innocent-glasgow-man-ordered-drop-18801028,2019-07-30 16:20:38+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
656109,thedcclothesline--2019-02-22--Prosecutors Reviewing 1400 Cases Tied to Houston Cop Whose Lies Got Innocent Couple Murdered,2/22/2019,thedcclothesline,"Prosecutors Reviewing 1,400 Cases Tied to Houston Cop Whose Lies Got Innocent Couple Murdered","Houston, TX — Despite their best intentions of sweeping the deaths of Dennis and Rhogena Tuttle under the rug, the Houston police department is currently under the microscope of the nation. Now, in yet another major move, the FBI is stepping in as well as Houston-area prosecutors, who will examine 1,400 other cases which are linked to the cop who fabricated evidence to spark the raid on this innocent couple—in which they were murdered in their own home by police.

One thing is nearly certain, and if this cop was willing to fabricate information to raid the home of an innocent couple who have lived in the same home for decades and were adored by all their neighbors—he’s likely done this before. So, prosecutors are stepping in and have their work cut out as HPD narcotics Officer Gerald Goines has been involved in more than 1,400 cases throughout his decades-long career of kicking in doors to find illegal substances.

NBC News reports that the FBI also said it has opened an independent civil rights investigation into Jan. 28 raid that left a man and a woman who lived at the home dead and several police officers shot and injured. The agency’s Houston office said the investigation is “into allegations that a search warrant obtained by Houston police officers was based on false, fabricated information.”

As TFTP reported over the weekend, after controversy and rumors have swarmed the case, the Houston police department has admitted that the entire raid was most likely based on the lies of one of their own.

“That’s totally unacceptable. I’ve told my police department that if you lie, you die,” Acevedo said Friday. “When you lie on an affidavit, that’s not sloppy police work, that’s a crime.”

When speaking of these crimes on Monday, Acevedo noted that the officer responsible for lying about this raid will likely be charged. As to what those charges are, however, we are still unclear.

Despite the fact that the officer has yet to be charged, the city’s proactive response to his deadly lies has been surprisingly swift.

“Our duty is to see that justice is done in every case,” Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg said in a statement. “Although the criminal investigation of Officer Goines is ongoing, we have an immediate ethical obligation to notify defendants and their lawyers in Goines’ other cases to give them an opportunity to independently review any potential defenses.”

What’s more, as TFTP reported Wednesday, the Houston police department is claiming they are taking steps to prevent future scenarios like this from happening—by ceasing the use of no-knock raids.

“The no-knock warrants are going to go away like leaded gasoline in this city,” Chief Art Acevedo said during a heated town hall meeting.

“I’m 99.9 percent sure we won’t be using them,” he continued. “If for some reason there would be a specific case, that would come from my office.”

With news of the 1,400 cases now being reviewed, others who say they have been unjustly charged are coming forward.

The family of a man arrested in one of the more than two dozen active cases currently tied to Goines is speaking out and has released a video of his arrest.

Exclusive video obtained by ABC13 Eyewitness News shows Goines’ arrest of Andrew Hebert last July.

ABC13 reports that Cheryl watched as her brother was arrested in front of the family home on Panay. Houston police said he led them on a chase, which he disputes. He followed their commands and surrendered. Cheryl then watched as Goines’ narcotics unit searched her brother’s car.

“They didn’t find anything inside his car,” she added.

Despite Cheryl noting that police didn’t find anything, Hebert was charged with two counts of possessing 200-400 grams of cocaine.

In light of the recent revelations, Hebert was just granted bail after being denied bond.

Another family came forward with even more damning information, claiming that Goines had a fit of road rage and killed a man.

Reginald Dorsey was fatally wounded in September 1997. What was first reported as a drug bust that turned violent, ended up being a case of road rage on the Southwest Freeway, according to ABC13.

Goines claimed Dorsey cut him off on the freeway and opened fire, leaving the officer no other option but to fire back. This was a claim the victim’s family denies and said Dorsey just defended himself from a plainclothes man who attacked him.

“We knew from the beginning it was a lie,” the victim’s sister, Rhonda Dorsey Williams said. “He murdered my brother. He murdered my brother.”

“You need to pay,” Williams said. “He needs to pay.”

“The concern, of course, is if it’s true, how much smoke is there and how much fire is there in his other cases? Is this just a one-off incident if he, in fact, lied or has been doing this in other cases, and that’s a grave concern to us as defense attorneys and our clients,” said Neal Davis, the vice president of the Harris County Criminal Lawyers Association.

Eroding away the notion of this being a one-off incident is the fact that the officer had heroin in his car that fateful day. Was he using this to frame people? Was it for personal consumption?

Hopefully, as the investigation continues, the answers to these questions and others will come out.

657322,thedcclothesline--2019-08-18--New Jersey Innocent Father and Daughter Held at Gunpoint on Knees as Cops Shot Their Dogs Lawsuit,8/18/2019,thedcclothesline,New Jersey: Innocent Father and Daughter Held at Gunpoint on Knees as Cops Shot Their Dogs — Lawsuit!,"Tinton Falls, NJ — Roberton Fullerton and his daughter Bobbi Rene Fullerton had committed no crime, had harmed no one, and were in their own home when police officers came to the door, ordered them to their knees at gunpoint and shot their two dogs. While apologists continue to claim “if you do nothing wrong, you have nothing to worry about,” this case — like so many others before it — proves them entirely wrong. Now the taxpayers of Tinton Falls will be held liable for the officers’ actions in the form of a lawsuit.

The Fullertons are now suing the Borough of Tinton Falls, Police Officer Adrian Reyes, several officers referred to only as “John Does,” and Police Chief John Scrivanic in federal court for an amount “yet to be determined.” for the disturbing abuse doled out by the officers. On Tuesday, the lawsuit was scheduled for pretrial.

“They were victims of excessive force. They were held at gunpoint by this officer (Reyes). They were scared out of their minds. The whole thing was very traumatic,” the Fullerton’s attorney Thomas J. Mallon told the Asbury Park Press.

According to the lawsuit, the incident unfolded on Oct. 8, 2017. Robert and Bobbi were having a verbal argument at their home that night when someone overheard them and called 911. Police were then dispatched to the residence.

There was no physical assault, and before any officers arrived, Robert Fullerton received a phone call from “longtime friend,” Tinton Falls Police Officer Lt. Kyle Pearson, the lawsuit states. Pearson confirmed everything was okay and that Robert had simply been arguing with his daughter. Officer Pearson, according to the lawsuit, then attempted to notify the responding officers that “no assault had occurred.” However, he was too late.

As the Asbury Park Press reports, notwithstanding, the police went to Fullerton’s home and knocked on the door. Robert Fullerton opened the door and stepped outside. Sadie, one of the plaintiffs’ German shepherds, brushed passed Fullerton, walked onto the driveway “and was immediately shot three times,” by Reyes, or one of the John Doe officers, the lawsuit said.

Reyes then “ordered Fullerton at gunpoint, with the gun pointed at his face, to get on the ground,” according to the lawsuit.

While on his knees, Robert watched as police then ordered his daughter to her knees as their dog Hannah followed her outside. Police then opened fire on Hannah, shooting the German Shepherd twice.

According to the report, Sadie died from the gunshots while Hannah was taken to a veterinary hospital. The Fullertons claim they incurred over $7,000 in veterinary expenses.

After watching the officers shoot their dogs all the while having guns pointed at their heads, neither of the Fullertons were charged with any crime and the officers left.

Imagine for a moment that non-police officers had gone to the Fullerton’s home, held them at gunpoint on their knees and shot their dogs. This story would be on the front page of newspapers across the country and may even be the subject of a feature film.

However, because the assailants were police officers, there will be very little media coverage and they will face zero accountability. And, as the video below illustrates, this is all done by design.

Luckily for the Fullertons, when the police officers shot their dogs, neither of them were shot in the process. Others cannot say the same.

As TFTP reported earlier this month, in Texas, police were conducting a welfare check on a sleeping woman who was reportedly napping in a grassy area near Canton Drive and North Collins Street in Arlington. Instead of receiving help, however, this sleeping woman received a fatal bullet.

According to police, as the officer approached the sleeping woman lying in the grass, he saw a stray dog. The officer claims to have called out to the woman when all of the sudden, the dog started charging him, so he fired his weapon several times. The officer missed the dog, but hit the woman instead. She did not survive.",Matt Agorist,https://www.dcclothesline.com/2019/08/18/new-jersey-innocent-father-and-daughter-held-at-gunpoint-on-knees-as-cops-shot-their-dogs-lawsuit/,2019-08-18 16:10:07+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
657928,"thedcclothesline--2019-11-01--Colorado: SWAT Team Blows Up Innocent Man’s Home in Search of Clothing Shoplifter—Deal With It, Says",11/1/2019,thedcclothesline,"Colorado: SWAT Team Blows Up Innocent Man’s Home in Search of Clothing Shoplifter—Deal With It, Says Court","Greenwood Village, CO – A Federal Appeals court has granted police new powers for which they will not be held accountable. They can now completely destroy your home and they will not have to pay for it. That’s what happened to Leo Lech’s home in 2015 after a shoplifter — accused of stealing a shirt — illegally entered his home, forcing Greenwood Village SWAT to go room by room ransacking the place with explosives.

The 19-hour standoff ended with the suspect being taken into custody, but not before the home, as TFTP previously reported, was destroyed. The place looked like it was hit with a bulldozer. None of the windows were intact, and the doors were blown off their hinges. The Lech family’s possessions were completely destroyed, left in tatters after the SWAT team showed no concern for the home nor its belongings. According to the DailyMail:

Initially, the Lech family was offered $5,000 in housing assistance and insurance deductible compensation, a far cry from what it would take to simply raze the home, let alone rebuild it. Leo Lech sued the city, but the court ruled what happened to the home did not amount to eminent domain and was simply a result of a police matter. Therefore, the city was under no obligation to condemn the home nor rebuild it. In other words, apart from the $5000, Lech was getting nothing else. Lech commented in 2015:

In 2017, after being offered the $5,000, Lech had this to say.

Lech appealed the decision to a higher court but on Wednesday was denied, yet again. He says he’s now going to appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States and he has a lot more to say about how police upended his life and the lives of his other family members.

Leo Lech was renting the destroyed home to his son John, his girlfriend, and their son. Far from being a tenant in a rental home, when police destroyed all of John’s possessions along with his dwelling, he says he was forced to live with his parents, find another job, and force his son to attend another school. The chaos which ensued from the SWAT melee which included an estimated 50 officers, truly caused the family an enormous amount of discomfort the family says. And, rightfully so, they are upset, to say the least. On Tuesday, Lech told the Washington Post:

It’s true America. We don’t know whether to categorize it as the effects of a Police State or Judicial Tyranny, but one man’s quest to get his home rebuilt by the very police department which completely destroyed it with grenades, explosives, gas canisters, battering rams, and an armored personnel carrier (typically used by the military), ended in defeat.

In the land of the free, the cops can now destroy your home completely and you’ll be left to pick up the pieces. Hopefully, Lech and his lawyers will appeal to the SCOTUS and the dangerous precedent will be overturned.

This has become abundantly apparent with the rigged jury decision to incarcerate Roger Stone for the “process crime” of misstating memories during interrogations with federal agents. In an era where Hillary Clinton is openly allowed by the director of the FBI (treasonous criminal James Comey) to destroy evidence, obstruct justice and get away with high-level crimes because “she didn’t mean to” violate the law, Roger Stone is about to be sentenced to what will essentially be life in prison (he’s 67 years old).

In an era when former president Barack Obama illegally laundered billions of dollars through international banks in order to fly actual pallets of cash to Iran to fund their nuclear weapons program, Julian Assange rots in custody, denied his freedom, his health and his sanity for over a decade, all as punishment for daring to expose the dark secrets of the military industrial complex.

The jury against Roger Stone was rigged with over 90% of the people in the jury pool found to be supporters of Hillary Clinton. The malicious fake news media smeared Stone for years, installing intense hatred in the minds of the jurists and cementing the outcome of the “trial,” if it can even be called that.

take our poll - story continues below

Meanwhile, Adam Schiff (Loonbag-CA) holds secret trials with secret transcripts in secret dungeons, coaching witnesses to say what he wants them to say while editing secret transcripts to make those witnesses appear to say things they never said. The treasonous media runs with every lie Schiff hands them, having long abandoned any last shred of journalistic integrity or basic human decency.

The rule of law has collapsed in America, and no one is safe from the hate-filled left-wing mob that now openly seeks to criminalize all political opposition.

If you oppose the Democrat mob, you will be targeted and destroyed

If you oppose the Democrats, you will eventually be targeted by the IRS (Lois Lerner, anyone?), arrested by the Feds in a midnight raid that’s coordinated with CNN (a la Roger Stone), de-platformed from all the major tech platforms, smeared on Wikipedia with an onslaught of fabricated lies, demonized by the fake news media with coordinated hit pieces (as the NYT just did with John Solomon) and harassed in public by violent, drooling left-wing mobs that are triggered into rage by the very sight of the American flag or a MAGA hat.

The juries in left-wing cities will never find a violent Leftist guilty, nor a conservative patriot innocent. A jury in San Francisco, for example, set an illegal alien free after he shot and killed an American woman in an obvious case of manslaughter, if not homicide. But he was set free because San Francisco is a “sanctuary” city, which means the people who run that collapsing sh#thole of feces and filth have decided to ignore the laws they don’t like.

And this is how things are now progressing — if you can call it that — all across the country, where the rule of law is abandoned at will, replaced by a raging, anti-American, anti-Trump, anti-freedom tyranny of the left-wing majority mob.

The left-wing dedication to authoritarianism and tyranny is now so complete that all the tech giants recently conspired to memory hole the name of the deep state spy “whistleblower” Eric Ciaramella. Even uttering that name will get you banned on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. Indeed, stating a name now gets you banned from the public square for the simple reason that the deep state has ordered the tech giants to eliminate that name from public discourse.

Similarly, the tech giants have now banned a Republican candidate for congress simply for being a Republican. Under the tyrannical thumb of Jack Dorsey, an un-indicted criminal guilty of treason against America for rigging elections, Twitter is now banning people for merely tweeting, “I hired Donald Trump to fire people like Yovanovitch,” referring to the lying former ambassador of Ukraine, who is whining about being fired after wasting taxpayer money by doing a lousy job as ambassador.

The effort to criminalize Trump’s foreign policy, you see, is really just a symptom of a much larger effort being pursued by the lawless, deranged, lunatic Left: The complete criminalization of “disobedience” to the left-wing agenda.

The real goal is the criminalization of conservatism

Try standing up at your local city council meeting and declaring, “There are only two genders,” and you’ll get a taste of the level of outright lunacy, violence and authoritarianism that has now infected the minds of the American people (including those who call themselves “conservatives” but have surrendered to the insanity of the Left in order to try to sue for peace).

The real goal of the authoritarian Left is to criminalize conservativism, Christianity and disobedience against every left-wing agenda, including their desire to pump your children full of chemical castration drugs in the name of “transgenderism” justice — just the latest mental illness to sweep through the ranks of deranged Leftists whose cognitive function now resembles that of zombies.

The attacks on Trump, Roger Stone, Alex Jones, John Solomon, Sean Hannity and other prominent independent analysts were never about the real rule of law… it has always been about criminalizing opposition and using the twisted “injustice” system to incarcerate anyone who stands in the way of the lawless left-wing mob and its criminal mafia mob bosses like Hillary Clinton.

Now, because of the collapse of the rule of law in America, here’s where we find ourselves:
• There is now no point in surrendering to any federal agent in any circumstance, since there is zero possibility of experiencing a fair trial. Everything will be rigged against you: The evidence, the judge, the witnesses, the jury and the media. You will be gagged, denied your right to defend yourself and denied the right to say “you didn’t mean to” like Hillary Clinton got away with.
• Federal law enforcement is hopelessly corrupt, with the FBI now running political smear operations and staging nearly all the domestic terrorism plots in America. The FBI, under people like Mueller and Comey, has not only been involved in covering up the truths about 9/11, Oklahoma City, the assassination of Dr. MLK, Jr., the Waco raids and the 1993 attempted bombing of the Twin Towers; it actually turns out the FBI ran those operations. (See FBIcorruption.news.)
• Federal judges have zero loyalty to the rule of law and absolute loyalty to the deep state. They have abandoned any last shred of even the pretense of following the Constitution and now exploit their positions of power to shore up the power of the deep state while destroying all those who threaten it.
• There is no expectation of safety for a law-abiding citizen, since any person can be targeted by the left-wing mob (a la Adam Schiff, the left-wing media, the tech giants, deep state agents, etc.) and then silenced, assassinated, indicted, audited or otherwise destroyed by any combination of establishment weapons against dissent.
• Elections are now hopelessly rigged, with Democrats controlling nearly every election outcome through a combination of illegals voting (14 states give driver’s licenses to illegal aliens now), ballot harvesting and vote stuffing by using cyber warfare techniques to make sure all the people who previously left a particular state magically vote for Democrats. This is how Kentucky’s recent election was rigged.
• Democrats are now openly calling for acts of violence and street warfare against not just conservative candidates but their financial supporters. Recently, a Democrat in Texas doxxed Trump donors, releasing their names and home addresses to the public in order to encourage left-wing Antifa brownshirts to harass and intimidate Trump donors.
• There is no free speech in America, as the tech giants have now brazenly conspired to silence all pro-Trump voices in their highly illegal conspiracy to rig all future elections. Yet somehow, they seem to face zero push back from regulators, the FTC, the DOJ or Republican lawmakers (with a few exceptions such as MO Sen. Hawley, who is leading the charge against Big Tech’s illegal censorship).
• Second Amendment rights are being rapidly dismantled by left-wing cities and states as they seek to completely disarm the citizenry so that no resistance can be mounted against the corruption, treason and tyranny of left-wing government run by extreme criminals known as “Democrats.”
• The “mainstream media” has now devolved into nothing but a coordinated smear engine to de-legitimize and de-humanize the political opponents of the radical Left. NBC News, in particular, is engaged in such malicious smears that one of their hate pieces targeting my own publishing company resulted in hundreds of deranged, violent left-wing lunatics calling and threatening the employee of a hosting company that hosts some of our websites. The child of one employee was even threatened in public school by other students who were children of radical left-wing Antifa parents. As All News Pipeline reports, “With the MSM also releasing ‘hit pieces‘ upon outlets such as The Federalist and the Western Journal, we keep coming back to just how deeply the CIA had infiltrated the mainstream media going all the way back to the early 1950’s and ‘Operation Mockingbird‘, the large-scale propaganda program designed to manipulate the news media and, in so doing, manipulate the minds of every man, woman and child across America.”
• Driven to psychological extremism by the hate-filled fake news media, Leftists are now openly celebrating the abandonment of due process and the politically targeted extermination of free speech, claiming that these basic civil rights of speech and law have no place in a “tolerant” society. Yes, that’s their actual argument. They claim free speech is “violence.”
• As a result, Twitter has now collapsed into a cesspool of radical left-wing extremism and “groupthink,” where all voices of opposition are silenced, effectively creating a feedback loop of left-wing insanity that now drives Democrat candidates to positions so extreme and insane that even Barack Obama now claims the Left has gone way too far. (When Obama tells you that you’ve gone too far to the Left, you’re beyond all hope…)
• Mass mental illness is now parading around as “progressivism,” even when the signs of mental illness are irrefutable, such as parents trying to physically chop off the reproductive organs of their baby boys in order to convert them into transgenders.

Under the tyrannical rule of lawless, mentally ill Democrats, the government is now run like an organized crime syndicate. John W. Whitehead of The Rutherford Institute sums it all up perfectly in a recent column:

All of us are in danger.

In an age of prosecutions for thought crimes, pre-crime deterrence programs, and government agencies that operate like organized crime syndicates, there is a new kind of tyranny being imposed on those who dare to expose the crimes of the Deep State, whose reach has gone global.

The Deep State has embarked on a ruthless, take-no-prisoners, all-out assault on truth-tellers.

Activists, journalists and whistleblowers alike are being terrorized, traumatized, tortured and subjected to the fear-inducing, mind-altering, soul-destroying, smash-your-face-in tactics employed by the superpowers-that-be.

Following the current downward trajectory, it won’t be long before anyone who believes in holding the government accountable is labeled an “extremist,” is relegated to an underclass that doesn’t fit in, must be watched all the time, and is rounded up when the government deems it necessary.

Eventually, we will all be potential suspects, terrorists and lawbreakers in the eyes of the government.

Now the collapse will accelerate, and America will become Venezuela

Now that the rule of law has collapsed in America, and the media has become a psychological terrorism hub run by the CIA, and the courts have abandoned all justice, and the elections are all rigged by treasonous Democrats, we are going to witness a rapid collapse into despotism, lawlessness and desperation.

The model for this collapse is already on display for the world to see: Venezuela.

A doctor who still survives the collapse of civil society in Venezuela, Maybell Nieves, has written about how this collapse accelerates year after year, stripping away every right and last shred of human decency from the citizens as the corrupt, treasonous government becomes powerful and treacherous to everyone:

That’s probably why those first few years didn’t really feel like something was taken away from us… Later came the control of the prices of basic products, which caused the disappearance of those items and initiated a black market that is also very much in force to this day.

The decay was soon seen in many aspects. There was no longer maintenance on public roads, and public services failed often until reaching the point of constant failures of electric service, even for days. The public health situation is also getting worse and worse. As a health professional, I have seen this deterioration for the last 10 years.

The state will rip you off, but it doesn’t happen all of a sudden. There are a lot of logistics; it takes a long time to develop the kind of policy that makes citizens totally dependent on the state.

You start by losing something unimportant, like some kind of monetary bonus now given to you as government-run grocery store credits, and you end up losing your freedom and all kinds of rights, including freedom of speech and protest, but these issues are so extensive that they require an article of their own to explain them properly.

The state has taken charge, with great success I must say, and you are now living in fear of the so-called public authorities, meaning police and military police, since they serve as pro-government forces of repression.

In any public protest, savage repression is a constant. That violence is what we Venezuelans have become used to.When there is no public or social security, when the devaluation of the currency is occurring on a daily basis, and when you don’t know if the bakery on the corner is going to be broken into tomorrow, at that moment, the debacle has already occurred.

So the mismanagement of incompetent and corrupt civil servants results in the deep separation of three social classes: extreme poverty, which represents more than 80% of the population and is totally dependent on the government; the working middle class, which manages to subsist through one or two basic incomes plus the economic help of family members abroad; and those who do business with the government and can live in a very comfortable, ideal world that has nothing to do with reality.

There comes a point at which the only thing in your mind is to know if you will return home alive. Everything else is secondary. At that point, the state has already massacred you internally. You can never be the same again. I’m sure I am not.

This is the future for America if We the People do not take this country back from the lawless, treasonous, eternally corrupt deep state puppetmasters

What you read above is what you will be living soon in America as the collapse continues:
• The streets of left-wing cities will be running with feces and filth. In many cities, they already are.
• The collapse of the rule of law will lead to exploding crime rates everywhere.
• Corporations like Google will decide all future elections, and if your speech does not agree with the ideas of unelected Google engineers, you will be silenced and demonized.
• The deep state will make sure that all voices of opposition to the corrupt establishment — including independent journalists — will be criminalized, arrested, indicted and likely “Jeffrey Epsteined.”
• As the rule of law collapses, business transactions will become increasingly difficult to complete. Eventually, food supplies will collapse and deliveries will cease, leading to mass food riots in the nation’s most populated cities.
• After Trump is removed from power by treasonous criminals in the deep state (Brennan, Comey, Mueller, McCabe, etc.), the federal government will declare war on the American people and go door to door, seizing guns, executing Christians, setting fire to the homes of conservatives, looting household valuables and kidnapping wives and daughters for human trafficking operations run in conjunction with UN troops which will also occupy U.S. soil.
• America will be turned into a war zone, with the government waging war against the Constitution, the People and human rights.
• The economic collapse will accelerate, leading to widespread impoverishment, starvation, desperation, crime and corruption.
• The violence of the lunatic Left will rapidly increase to the point where Leftists openly engage in executions, rapings, kidnappings, lootings and anything else they can get away with, always targeting conservatives and “white people,” thanks to the hatred pushed by the NYT, WashPost, CNN, MSNBC and late night comedy shows like Jimmy Kimmel.

The rule of LAW now collapses to the rule of FORCE

You can probably imagine what else will occur. Basically it’s the collapse of human society. During all this, of course, armed American patriots will be taking it to the criminal traitors in all sorts of various ways, all across America. It will probably be open season on corruption, everywhere across America. Sadly, with the rule of law now dead in America, any reasonable person must wonder incentive remains for anyone to abide by any law whatsoever?

The only thing that matters to the corrupt Democrats now is force. The radical Left will use force to destroy you if you don’t comply. They will have you arrested at gunpoint or attacked on the streets at the hands of violent Antifa mobs. They will even force you to vaccinate your children at gunpoint… or they will medically kidnap your children at gunpoint if you refuse to comply.

Force is now the only rule remaining in deep state-controlled America. Everything else has collapsed. There is no free speech, no fair trial, no system of justice, no reasonable expectation of human rights anywhere, no fair elections, no honest news, no honest Wall Street operations, no real public education, no clean food, no certainty of safety with products purchased on Amazon.com, no faith in the broken banking system, no faith that any elected official will keep any promises, no trust in the FBI or federal law enforcement and no reasonable expectation that anything will get better.

Just as I promised they would, the Democrats are destroying everything of value as they seek to demolish human decency, human rights and human society. This is their goal. Do not be deluded into thinking anything else.

It won’t be long before this website is blockaded by all internet tech companies, by the way. All voices of dissent will be erased and memory holed. You will soon be on your own.

Prepare to take steps to defend your survival, for that is what all this has come to. If you aren’t willing to defend your nation, your Constitution, your life and the rule of law, then the DEMONrats have already won and humanity will be extinguished in no time at all.

665002,thedenverpost--2019-11-04--Guest Commentary: Lying jailhouse informants shouldn’t put innocent Coloradans behind bars,11/4/2019,thedenverpost,Guest Commentary: Lying jailhouse informants shouldn’t put innocent Coloradans behind bars,"Imagine being convicted of a brutal crime you did not commit as a teenager. The recent Netflix series “When They See Us” told the story of the Central Park Five, a group of teenagers who were wrongly convicted of raping a jogger in New York City. Korey Wise was one of those young men, and he is the namesake of the innocence project that I direct at Colorado Law.

Similar injustices have happened in our state. This week marks 18 years since Lawrence Montoya was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the 2000 murder of a teacher in Denver. At the age of 15 he was sent to prison because of lies told by a jailhouse informant.

The prosecution’s case largely relied on a jailhouse informant who claimed that Lawrence confessed to him when they shared a room together in juvenile detention as Lawrence awaited trial. The jailhouse informant gave details that appeared to be corroborated by a crime scene expert, and the jailhouse informant’s mother said that he told her about the alleged confession shortly after it happened.

To a jury, it looked like the jailhouse informant was telling the truth. In reality, he never shared a room with Lawrence. His testimony was inconsistent with both the physical evidence and earlier statements he gave to law enforcement. The prosecution also denied that the jailhouse informant got a deal. However, his probation sentence for burglary was terminated shortly after he agreed to testify. The prosecution failed to meet its constitutional obligation to disclose this information to the defense. As a result, Lawrence’s lawyers could not adequately expose the jailhouse informant’s motivations and credibility to the jury.

On November 3, 2000, Lawrence was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole. It would take over a decade for DNA testing to undermine the conviction and for Lawrence to finally be released from prison.

It was too easy for lies told by a jailhouse informant to wrongfully convict Lawrence Montoya. The unchecked system of offering leniency for testimony also harms crime victims and public safety. When a jailhouse informant receives a reduced sentence or gets his charges dismissed, what kind of message does that send to the victims of his own crimes? Plus, when the questionable testimony of an informant leads to the conviction of an innocent person, the actual perpetrators may go on to harm others.

As more cases like Lawrence’s have come to light, there has been a growing national movement to increase transparency and scrutiny around jailhouse witnesses. This year, Connecticut passed a new law that will create the nation’s first statewide system to track the use of and benefits provided for their testimony. The measure will give prosecutors more complete information to vet potential jailhouse witnesses before putting them on the stand.

Additionally, Connecticut and Illinois require judges to hold pre-trial hearings to screen out unreliable testimony before it is heard by jurors. Recently, Nebraska and Texas passed laws specifying when and what types of evidence the prosecution must disclose to the defense if it plans to use a jailhouse witness.

Nebraska’s law also requires that victims of a jailhouse informant’s crimes be notified if charges are dismissed or reduced in exchange for cooperation. A number of states including Oklahoma and Utah give special jury instructions about the specific factors that should be considered when evaluating jailhouse informant testimony.

What happened to Lawrence Montoya shouldn’t happen to any other innocent person. Colorado should adopt the safeguards that have been implemented in other states when the legislature meets this session.

689644,theguardianuk--2019-02-11--Spare innocent men anguish India ruling aims to end false rape claims,2/11/2019,theguardianuk,'Spare innocent men anguish': India ruling aims to end false rape claims,"Their romance began at work. She asked him out for coffee with her friends. He took her out for lunch. Dinners and walks in New Delhi’s Lodhi Gardens followed. Then, for 18 months, they were in a sexual relationship.

But last year, when Pavan Gupta* turned 24, his parents began pressuring him to marry. When they introduced him to a girl he liked, Gupta ended his relationship with his girlfriend, Geeta Jain, telling her he could not disappoint his parents. “I liked her but I didn’t want to spend the rest of my life with her. I always told her I was an only child and would have to go along with my parents’ choice,” says Gupta.

In March, as Gupta was preparing for his wedding, Jain went to the Delhi police and accused him of rape. She said she had slept with him only on promise of marriage and, since he had not married her, consent was procured on a false pretext, making the sex rape.

“Even if I had misled her and told her I’d marry her, it still wouldn’t make the sex rape. How can consensual sex for over a year be rape?” asks Gupta.

Last month, the supreme court ruled that rape cannot be invoked in cases of consensual sex after a relationship ends and the man declines to marry the woman, for whatever reason. The judges said a clear distinction had to be drawn between the two. But the ruling is of no help to Gupta. His life has already been shattered.

His mother had a heart attack a week after she learned of the accusation against him. She died a few days later. His fiancee called off the wedding. He lost his job. His peace of mind was destroyed. The trial is dragging on because Jain frequently does not attend hearings.

Something strange is going on in India. Women are becoming more educated and confident. Pre-marital sex is on the rise – a hotel chain called StayUncle offers rooms for an hour or two to couples seeking somewhere to have sex. But at the same time, so are the number of women alleging rape on false promise of marriage.

According to the National Crime Records Bureau, a total of 38,947 rape cases were reported in India in 2016. In 10,068 cases – about a quarter – the women claimed it was rape on false promise of marriage. In Andhra Pradesh state, 45% of all rape cases filed in the past two years fell into the false marriage category.

“When a relationship ends, women who have had consensual sex make false accusations of rape under promise of marriage out of vengefulness, to hurt the man. Or they do it to extort money out of him, promising to withdraw the charge if he gives them what they want,” says lawyer Vinay Sharma.

Sitting in his tiny chambers in Dwarka, Sharma, who is handling 90 such cases, gestures discreetly to two families waiting for him on the other side of the glass partition. “The girl’s family has agreed to withdraw the charge in return for 500,000 rupees (£5,400),” he says. “Tell me, would any parent settle for money rather than justice if she’s really been raped?”

In many cases, false rape accusations are simply the result of parents covering up the “shame” of an unmarried daughter having sex. Research carried out in 2015 by journalist Rukmini Shrinivasan, who worked for the Hindu newspaper at the time, revealed that when parents discover their unmarried daughters are in a sexual relationship, their horror at potential “dishonour” to the family name leads many to make spurious allegations of rape, having first bullied their children into submission.

By their logic, saying a daughter has been raped is preferable to people thinking she is sexually active. Shrinivasan stumbled upon this finding after discerning a pattern in the charge sheets she examined in Mumbai. Time and again, it was the same story: the victim had been picked up in a moving car, given a drink laced with sedatives to render her unconscious, and raped.

The recurrence of the sedative-laced drink seemed striking. Then the penny dropped. “This allegation is important because it is necessary to show that consent was not given, to protect the girl’s reputation,” says Shrinivasan.

Sharma supports her findings. He says the same story can be found in 50 of his 90 cases. “Only the names, dates and locations are different, otherwise they all narrate the story of sedatives and drinks when in fact the girls were in a relationship and willingly having sex,” he says.

Shrinivasan’s research into the 460 rape cases that came to trial in New Delhi in 2013 revealed that “more than one third turned out to be cases of couples having consensual sex outside marriage but, when the parents found out, they went to the police to end the relationship”.

Men’s rights groups and some lawyers believe these false allegations of rape by women who have been in consensual relationships trivialise the seriousness of rape. They raise plenty of questions, too. Even if a man promised to marry a woman, can he not change his mind? How can judges determine a man’s sincerity or falsity in talking of marriage?

Even more troubling is that the notion of sex constituting rape if a man “reneges” on a promise of marriage is not in the penal code. It has evolved on a case-by-case basis as a result of judges choosing to interpret the notion of “consent” in this fashion. As a consequence, men can be charged with rape if they falsely obtain consent for sex by promising to marry a woman and then changing their mind.

The only solace for men who have been falsely accused is that many of these cases are thrown out of court. The supreme court ruling last month, for example, related to a nurse at a government hospital in Maharashtra. She was a widow who fell in love with a doctor and moved in with him. After living together for some years, he left her and married someone else.

The judges said that having lived with the man for some years, the nurse could not allege rape. They pointed out that it was possible the doctor, on account of circumstances he could not have foreseen or could not control, was not able or willing to marry her. Whatever the reason, it was not rape. The doctor was acquitted.

But between the arrest and the acquittal lies much distress. Jeevan Kishore is married with two children and works as a “halwai” or sweet maker in New Delhi. He started a sexual relationship with a much older woman who was separated from her husband and had two children. “She was financially in bad shape. I used to lend her money, pay for her rent sometimes, and for medical costs if her relatives back in the village fell ill,” says Kishore.

When her young son fell ill, Kishore paid the hospital bills. When he died, he paid for the funeral. Then, he says, she began demanding larger and larger sums of money. “She told me if I didn’t give her the money, she would accuse me of rape. I was dumbstruck,” he says.

Eighteen months ago, that’s exactly what she did. Last month, he was acquitted. “My wife was angry with me over my unfaithfulness but she knew I was incapable of rape. I thank God the judge realised it was a false case. But for 18 months, I burned with shame every time I went out or met anyone,” says Kishore.

Vivek Deveshwar, a software engineer in Bangalore who runs a men’s rights group, has come across far too many shattered men. “Their trust in human relationships is destroyed. They withdraw into a shell, not knowing who they can trust and they are very frightened of embarking on another relationship,” he says.

He believes that parents who make false allegations of rape are encouraged by the fact that rape victims’ identities are not revealed. Consequently, there is no social embarrassment. “I believe a man’s identity should also be kept secret until the trial is over and a verdict has been reached. It would spare innocent men a lot of anguish,” he says.

Seema Misra, a lawyer in New Delhi, says that false cases under breach of promise to marry are a “huge” issue, one that she finds upsetting. “There is a limit to how far women can portray themselves as victims. At some point we have to take responsibility for our actions – 90% of the cases I have seen are false,” she says.

For feminist lawyers like Misra, the subject is fraught with problems. They realise that such cases reflect the premium put on a woman’s chastity by a very patriarchal society – no unmarried woman can be seen to be sexually active outside marriage – but oppose the abuse of rape laws.

Many observers feel that false claims brought by women who argue they were duped into losing their virginity serve only to undermine efforts to promote gender equality. “These cases should not be treated as rape. If we are talking of women’s agency, then we can’t have it both ways,” says lawyer and activist Vrinda Grover.

Grover believes that last month’s supreme court ruling will help in setting a precedent for the lower courts to follow. Ultimately, though, she believes the legal system must find another way to give women justice if they have suffered harm at the hands of a man. “The system needs to offer some form of relief – either damages or in some other way – because desperate women are resorting to the rape charge, which is wrong, but that’s because they have no other remedy. The law needs to develop a different perspective,” says Grover.

In the meantime, she worries that false charges of rape over consensual sexual relationships serve only to dilute genuine cases and distort the debate about rape in India. On this, Deveshwar concurs: “The tragedy is that with so many false cases, genuine victims of rape may find it harder to get justice.”

699896,theguardianuk--2019-05-07--Pamela Anderson visits innocent man Julian Assange in prison,5/7/2019,theguardianuk,Pamela Anderson visits 'innocent man' Julian Assange in prison,"Pamela Anderson has described Julian Assange as “the world’s most innocent man” and said a fight was on to “save his life”, after the actor and model visited the WikiLeaks founder at Belmarsh prison.

She was accompanied by the website’s editor-in-chief, Kristinn Hrafnsson, for what WikiLeaks described as Assange’s first social visit since he was arrested by police after Ecuador revoked the political asylum granted to him at the country’s London embassy.

A struggle over a US request for Assange’s extradition is under way after he was jailed for just under a year for breaching bail conditions to avoid being extradited to Sweden. Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition over sexual assault allegations, which he denies.

“He does not deserve to be in a supermax prison. He has never committed a violent act. He is an innocent person,” Anderson said outside the prison in south-east London, which is a maximum-security jail but holds a range of prisoners.

Anderson said he was “really cut off from everybody” and had not been able to access the internet, use a library or speak to his children.

“He is a good man, he is an incredible person. I love him, I can’t imagine what he has been going through,” said Anderson, who was wearing what appeared to be a cape covered with text that made references to prison, tyranny and Oliver Cromwell.

She tweeted a link to a Wikipedia page for John Lilburne, an English Leveller who was a friend of Cromwell but whose opposition to the policies of his regime led to his trial for sedition in 1649. She also tweeted a photograph of a handwritten letter that appeared to have been signed by her and another celebrity supporter of Assange, the fashion designer Vivienne Westwood.

“We need to save his life. That is how serious it is,” Anderson said.

Hrafnsson, who last week criticised “austerity and cutbacks” in the prison system and said Assange usually spends 23 hours a day in his cell, added: “He has lost weight but his spirit is strong and that is the most important thing.”

During a court appearance last Thursday, Assange declined a chance to consent to his extradition to the US in a hearing at Westminster magistrates court, where lawyers for Washington began pressing the case to take him across the Atlantic. Ben Brandon, the counsel for the US government, said the charges related to one of the largest compromises of information in US history.

712530,theguardianuk--2019-10-16--'It breaks down innocent people': the interrogation method at center of Ava DuVernay lawsuit,10/16/2019,theguardianuk,'It breaks down innocent people': the interrogation method at center of Ava DuVernay lawsuit,"The director Ava DuVernay and Netflix are facing a lawsuit from the police consulting firm behind a widely criticized interrogation technique referenced in the miniseries When They See Us.

John E Reid and Associates, a US company that trains law enforcement on interrogations, filed a defamation suit on Monday, challenging DuVernay’s critically acclaimed Netflix drama based on the case known as the Central Park Five. When They See Us is a four-part dramatization of the true story of five black and brown teenage boys from Harlem who were wrongfully convicted of the rape of a white woman in Central Park in the spring of 1989.

The case is now known as one of the most notorious examples of police coercing people into giving false confessions, and the show powerfully depicts the harrowing interrogations the young boys faced and the racist prosecution that followed. The five teens went to prison and were eventually exonerated by DNA evidence.

Since the 1970s, John E Reid and Associates has taught an interrogation method known as “the Reid technique”, which was directly discussed in DuVernay’s series.

The complaint cited a quote from a prosecutor character in the series who questions a police detective’s interrogations of the boys, saying: “You squeezed statements out of them after 42 hours of questioning and coercing … The Reid technique has been universally rejected.” The detective responds: “I don’t even know what the fucking Reid Technique is.”

The firm’s lawsuit accuses Netflix of making false and defamatory statements, seeks damages and demands an injunction blocking Netflix from streaming the series, unless they “delete the defamatory references”. The suit alleges that the show misrepresents the nature of the Reid technique by suggesting that “coercing” statements from juveniles after “long hours of questioning without food, bathroom breaks or parental supervision” is “synonymous” with this method.

It’s unclear exactly how defamation laws might cover this fictionalized dialogue. The complaint is, however, bringing renewed attention to the Reid technique, the company’s trainings, and related interrogation techniques and controversies.

The technique, which was devised by a former police officer and polygraph expert, has increasingly been the subject of scrutiny by scholars and lawyers, who say that research and ongoing exonerations have shown it leads to false confessions. Critics charge that the method and similar practices involve interrogators pressuring and intimidating suspects, making it seem as if the police have proof of guilt, “minimizing” the seriousness of crime and potential consequences and presenting confession as the easiest way out of the situation.

In 2017, Wicklander-Zulawski and Associates, a large consulting group that has worked with the majority of police departments across the US, announced it would stop using the Reid technique, specifically due to concerns about false confessions.

Alan Hirsch, the chair of the justice and law studies program at Williams College, has testified in roughly 30 cases about the Reid technique.

“It’s an interrogation method designed to create anxiety, stress and eventually desperation,” he told the Guardian. “The suspect concludes that confessing is the best or even the only way out … It breaks down innocent people as well as guilty people. It’s too effective.”

The “overwhelming majority of PhD social scientists who research and write about the Reid method of interrogation believe that it can be and sometimes is psychologically coercive” and increases the risk of false confessions, added Richard Leo, a law and psychology professor at the University of San Francisco and leading expert on the subject.

Keren Goldenberg, a criminal defense lawyer in Massachusetts, said the depictions of interrogations in When They See Us rang true to her.

“The Reid technique really capitalizes on the fear and the weaknesses of the person who is sitting in front of the interrogator,” she said.

John E Reid and Associates was “grasping at straws and fiercely protecting their brand”, added Hayley Cleary, an associate professor of criminal justice at Virginia Commonwealth University and an expert on police interrogations. She noted that other countries had largely moved away from the practice.

Cleary said she was grateful to When They See Us for potentially helping future jurors understand that people can be pressured to confess to crimes they did not commit: “Normalizing the idea that false confessions can happen is really, really important.”

Representatives for DuVernay and Netflix did not respond to requests for comment. John E Reid and Associates and their attorneys in the case, Jack Carriglio and Corey Hickman, also did not respond to interview requests.

The company’s lawsuit includes the defense it has repeatedly offered – that false confessions don’t come from the application of the Reid technique, “but rather they are usually caused by interrogators engaging in improper behavior that is outside of the parameters … behaviors which the courts have found to be coercive – threats, promises, denial of rights”.

The technique does not involve assaulting suspects, denying them rights, conducting excessively long interrogations and some of the other particularly brutal tactics depicted in the series, the lawsuit also said.

Goldenberg predicted the company’s suit would only escalate scrutiny of its methods and make its PR problem even worse: “The more attention drawn to the technique, the less police departments are going to want to use it, because there’s this negative association.”",Sam Levin in Los Angeles,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2019/oct/15/when-they-see-us-ava-duvernay-netflix-lawsuit-reid,"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 05:00:08 GMT","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
726817,thehuffingtonpost--2019-05-04--Wells Fargo Botched A Fraud Inquiry An Innocent Man Landed In Court,5/4/2019,thehuffingtonpost,Wells Fargo Botched A Fraud Inquiry. An Innocent Man Landed In Court.,"Over the past two and a half years, Wells Fargo has admitted to mistakenly foreclosing on hundreds of families, illegally repossessing more than 27,000 cars and fraudulently opening over 3 million accounts for people who never asked for them. The bank has undertaken at least four separate marketing campaigns aimed at improving its dreadful corporate image, issuing official apology after official apology for its litany of abuses. It has rolled out a new logo and a new brand tagline, and replaced its CEO twice since the fake account scandal started to make headlines.

For Edwards, the madness began in April 2018, when the New Jersey Turnpike Authority noticed a problem with several checks the agency had written. Somehow the checks were being deposited not once but twice, with different dollar amounts each time. The immediate suspicion was check forgery ― someone, it seemed, had copied a stack of legitimate checks from the agency, scanned in a new name and new dollar amounts, and deposited the forgeries at a Wells Fargo branch in Parsippany.

The police decided not to charge Mathis, concluding she was a victim of the scheme, rather than a culprit. It’s common, in fact, for scammers to talk people into depositing checks on their behalf. Banks make money available to their customers immediately after a check is deposited, and it can take a few days for the transaction to be flagged as fraudulent. When that happens, whoever received the bogus funds has to pay everything back in full ― even if they’ve already handed over some of the money over to someone else, like the mysterious Cousin Swing.

None of this should have been a problem for Edwards. He’d never met Mathis or Cousin Swing. But he had deposited four checks of his own on April 16, at the same Wells Fargo branch where Cousin Swing deposited the forgeries. And Wells Fargo seems to have screwed up the surveillance evidence it provided to the police, handing them images from the bank’s ATM of Edwards depositing his checks. Edwards didn’t fit the description Mathis had given police of Cousin Swing ― but police trusted the bank to have its records straight. Neither Wells Fargo nor the New Jersey State Police would comment for this story, citing ongoing litigation.

Edwards had been going to the same bank branch for nearly three decades, remaining a customer as new corporate owners took over his account via a series of mergers. The bank became a Wells Fargo in 2008, when Wells took over the remains of Wachovia, which failed during the financial crisis. The church even kept its official accounts there. So Edwards knew there were bank records that would show that his deposits on April 16 were ordinary, legal transactions. He reached out to the police, sending Detective William Condron his bank statement and copies of the legitimate checks he’d deposited, explaining there had been a mistake.

Condron was skeptical, but he went back to Wells Fargo and asked the bank to make sure Edwards was the right guy. This should have been a red flag for both the bank and the police. Check fraud isn’t a super-sophisticated crime, but usually the perpetrators are smart enough to avoid using their own local bank. If the bank catches you engaging in fraud on camera, there’s a decent chance they’ll recognize you whenever you come back in. It was extremely unlikely that the person running the fraud scheme was a long-term customer who just happened to start sprinkling bogus checks in with his regular banking activity.

Edwards didn’t hear back from the police for a while. A little over a week after he first reached out to them, he called Condron again to follow up. Edwards says Condron told him he was getting bounced “from department to department” by the bank. He was dealing with people deep in the Wells Fargo bureaucracy ― the subpoena compliance team and someone from a “research unit,” at least one of whom, the detective said, was in Arizona.

So Edwards went down to his local branch, hoping to put everything to rest with the bank itself. The branch manager had never heard of his case, but promised to bring it up with her bosses. When he checked back a few days later, Edwards was told it was now in the hands of the bank’s “resolutions” team ― at least the third internal department at Wells Fargo to touch the debacle.

Edwards didn’t learn about the other photograph and the other forged check until months later, when his case went to trial. On Sept. 4, the police called Edwards and asked him to come down to their headquarters ― more than an hour’s drive from where he lived ― to clear everything up. When Edwards arrived the next day, he was taken to an interrogation room and berated. Police showed him the ATM photos with the forged check numbers scrawled across them, saying these images proved he was guilty of a crime. He’d better confess if he knew what was good for him.",,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/wells-fargo-customer-fraud_n_5ccb2153e4b0d123955021ce,2019-05-04 12:00:19+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
744392,theindependent--2019-01-31--Innocent people caught up in serious police investigations due to data-handling errors watchdog fin,1/31/2019,theindependent,"Innocent people caught up in serious police investigations due to data-handling errors, watchdog finds","Innocent people were wrongly caught up in serious police investigations such as child pornography and paedophile grooming because of data-handling errors, a watchdog found.

The failures led to homes being searched, equipment seized, and people being arrested for crimes they had nothing to do with.

In its first annual report, the Investigatory Powers Commissioner’s Office (IPCO) said it carried out 33 “serious error investigations” in 2017 – 24 of which were deemed to be serious errors.

In many cases they were caused by the submission of an incorrect phone number or IP address – sometimes by just one digit.

They resulted in 11 cases, affecting 19 individuals, where innocent people were interviewed or arrested by police.

In seven cases, affecting 10 people, police visited the home or work address of an individual with “no sustainable link” with an investigation.

Fifteen of the investigations related to unspecified “public authorities” and the rest to internet or communications service providers.

“Errors in this context can have grave consequences for the victims of the mistake, together with his or her family and friends,” the report said. ""This is particularly evident when home or offices are searched and the nature of the investigation is revealed to members of the individual’s family, and his or her neighbours or employer.

“Children are at risk of being taken into care and individuals in notifiable, and other, occupations may be suspended or dismissed. Strict bail conditions can result in a suspect having to leave his or her home.”

Overall, the IPCO, which has taken over the work of three predecessor bodies, found that while the number of serious cases was broadly the same as the previous year, the total number of errors reported was down from 1,200 to 926.

It said that it was unable to say with “absolute confidence” that the fall was significant, and that it was “in all probability a positive development”.

The Investigatory Powers Commissioner Lord Justice Sir Adrian Fulford expressed concern that the IPCO’s inspectorate and “numerically small” legal and policy team may have been “insufficiently resourced” to carry out the functions assigned to it.",Chiara Giordano,http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/police-errors-watchdog-data-wrongful-arrest-child-pornography-paedophile-grooming-a8757346.html,2019-01-31 20:26:03+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
765122,theindependent--2019-07-03--Police urged to axe facial recognition after research finds four of five apossuspectsapos are in,7/3/2019,theindependent,Police urged to axe facial recognition after research finds four of five &apos;suspects&apos; are innocent,"Scotland Yard has been urged to stop using facial recognition technology after independent research found that four out of five people identified as possible suspects were innocent.

Researchers at the University of Essex found that the Metropolitan Police’s live facial recognition (LFR) system was inaccurate in the huge majority of cases: the technology made only eight out of 42 matches correctly across six trials evaluated.

The report, commissioned by the Met, raised “significant concerns” that use of the controversial technology breaks human rights laws.

It also warned it is “highly possible” the use of facial recognition would be held unlawful if challenged in court.

The report’s authors, Professor Peter Fussey and Dr Daragh Murray, called for all Scotland Yard’s live trials of LFR to be ceased until the concerns are addressed.

Duncan Ball, the Met’s deputy assistant commissioner, said the force was “extremely disappointed with the negative and unbalanced tone” of the report – insisting the pilot had been successful.

The Neoface system uses special cameras to scan the structure of faces in a crowd of people to create a digital image, comparing the result against a watch list made up of pictures of people who have been taken into police custody.

If a match is found, officers at the scene where cameras are set up are alerted.

According to the Met’s website, the force has used the technology several times since 2016, including at Notting Hill Carnival that year and the following year.

Use of the facial recognition is currently under judicial review in Wales following the technology’s first ever legal challenge, brought against South Wales Police by Liberty.

Hannah Couchman, policy and campaigns officer for the civil rights group, renewed their calls for a ban on the technology after the research was published.

“This damning assessment of the Met’s trial of facial recognition technology only strengthens Liberty's call for an immediate end to all police use of this deeply invasive tech in public spaces,” she said.

“It would display an astonishing and deeply troubling disregard for our rights if the Met now ignored this independent report and continued to deploy this dangerous and discriminatory technology. We will continue to fight against police use of facial recognition which has no place on our streets.”

The report’s authors were granted access to the final six of 10 trials run by the Metropolitan Police, running from June last year to February 2019.

The research also highlighted concerns over criteria for the watch list as information was often not current, which saw police stopping people whose case had already been addressed.

It also found numerous operational failures and raised a number of concerns regarding “consent, public legitimacy and trust”.

Dr Murray said: “This report raises significant concerns regarding the human rights law compliance of the trials. The legal basis for the trials was unclear and is unlikely to satisfy the ‘in accordance with the law’ test established by human rights law.

“It does not appear that an effective effort was made to identify human rights harms or to establish the necessity of LFR. Ultimately, the impression is that human rights compliance was not built into the Metropolitan Police’s systems from the outset, and was not an integral part of the process.”

Deputy Commissioner Ball responded to the report: “This is new technology, and we’re testing it within a policing context.

“The Met’s approach has developed throughout the pilot period, and the deployments have been successful in identifying wanted offenders.

769541,theindependent--2019-08-25--Innocent man jailed for 82 days and loses jobs for bringing three jars of honey back to US,8/25/2019,theindependent,Innocent man jailed for 82 days and loses jobs for bringing three jars of honey back to US,"Which is why during his Christmas visit to relatives in Jamaica, he made his regular stop and bought three bottles from a favourite roadside stand before heading home to Maryland.

It was a routine purchase for him until he landed at the airport in Baltimore.

US customs officers detained Mr Haughton and police arrested him, accusing him of smuggling in not honey, but liquid methamphetamine.

Mr Haughton spent nearly three months in jail before all charges were dropped and two rounds of law enforcement lab tests showed no controlled substances in the bottles.

By then, Mr Haughton, who according to his lawyer had no criminal record, had lost both of his jobs as a cleaner and a construction worker.

“They messed up my life,” Mr Haughton said. “I want the world to know that the system is not right. If I didn’t have strong people around me, they would probably leave me in jail. You’re lost in the system.”

Months after his release, he is only now fully rebuilding his life after the setback devastated him and his family of six children.

Mr Haughton’s status as a legal permanent resident with a green card complicated his case.

Because he was arrested at an airport for alleged drug felonies, his case triggered a federal detention order that extended his time in jail, court testimony shows.

Twenty days after his arrest, a state police lab test looking for drugs in the bottles came up negative.

Yet the 45-year-old father sat behind bars for two more months before the last of the charges were dropped after a second all-clear in a federal lab test.

“Someone dropped the ball somewhere,” Mr Haughton’s lawyer Terry Morris said. “An innocent man spent 82 days in jail for bringing honey into the United States.”

After landing at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport on 29 December at around 10pm, US Customs and Border Protection detained Mr Haughton for more than two hours before Maryland Transportation Authority Police put him in handcuffs, according to charging documents.

The bottles with gold-coloured screw tops labelled “honey” in his bag, they told him, had tested positive in a drug field test for methamphetamine.

Mr Haughton fainted. Police took him to a hospital. Then they took him to jail.

Every year for the nearly 10 years since Mr Haughton has been living in Prince George’s County, the native of Jamaica travels to the island in December to visit his mother.

The green card holder never had any problem returning to Maryland until last year, when a police dog unit started sniffing around his bag.

Mr Haughton thought the dog was interested in his leftover chicken. But Mr Haughton said he quickly noticed agents and officers whispering to one another before disappearing behind a screen. When they returned, a man took Mr Haughton away. His bag didn’t come with him.

Police in charging documents said a dog named Beny conducted a “random scan” and alerted to possible drugs.

“Inside the bag were three large plastic bottles labelled as ‘honey’ of suspected liquid methamphetamine,” charging documents said.

Mr Haughton and Mr Morris contend he was stereotyped because of his race. Authorities, Mr Haughton’s lawyer said, questioned him about “a big Jamaican gang and drug-dealing conspiracy”.

“I’m 100 per cent sure I don’t have drugs,” Mr Haughton recalled telling the agents. “I only have honey.”

Mr Haughton had given up sugar years ago but drinks honey with his tea.

He prefers honey from a particular bee farm in Jamaica because it is cheaper and “more pure” and always asks friends visiting the island to bring him back some.

Carey Phillips, Mr Haughton’s girlfriend, said that when he didn’t come home from his Jamaica trip, she assumed he had extended his stay as he had done in the past and couldn’t get in touch with her.

But days later she got a letter from the Anne Arundel County detention centre from Mr Haughton.

“I was shocked,” Ms Phillips said. “It seems unreal to me. If someone does a crime, you understand, but if there’s nothing, that time is wasted.”

Mr Haughton – facing at least 25 years in jail – appeared in court for a bail review two days after his arrest.

A public defender at the hearing said Mr Haughton had no prior convictions and had lived in the area for the past nine years. A judge agreed to let him go on work release, court files and recordings of the hearing show.

But more than three weeks later, Mr Haughton was still behind bars.

The drug charges triggered detention orders from customs officials, Mr Haughton’s lawyer said.

Although the Maryland State Police lab returned test results on the bottles that indicated “No CDS detected” on 17 January, and although prosecutors had dropped the three felony drug counts on 23 January, Mr Haughton was still facing a misdemeanour charge for possession of a controlled dangerous substance, or CDS.

Mr Haughton asked to be released on 24 January at his second bail review, but Anne Arundel County District Court judge Laura Robinson worried he would not appear for trial.

“The problem is I can’t let him go to ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] because he would be deported potentially,” the judge said, according to a recording of the hearing. “Even if I released you, you still wouldn’t necessarily be released. You would go into federal detention.”

Mr Haughton was sent back to jail, appearing in court for a third bail review on 5 February.

Mr Morris, Mr Haughton’s lawyer, told the judge that Mr Haughton should be released because the immigration detainer was triggered by the felony charges, which had been dropped.

The federal government was in the middle of last winter’s shutdown, and Mr Morris said he couldn’t reach anyone at immigration and customs enforcement to lift the detainer.

“The thing that’s going to end up happening, and they’re going to realise it is, it’s just honey,” Mr Morris said during the bail review. “He’s been in jail for 30 days for honey.”

The judge said she would consider releasing Mr Haughton on his own recognisance but only if the federal government pulled the detention order.

“The ICE detainer is really prohibitive,” the judge said. “I’m kind of up against it on the ICE detainer.”

Had Mr Haughton been stopped at any other location, according to multiple immigration lawyers, federal authorities probably would not have issued a detainer for him.

But because Mr Haughton was stopped at a port of entry at an airport, the felony charges probably triggered “inadmissibility proceedings”, which require only that law enforcement officials have “reason to believe” someone is a drug trafficker to trigger possible deportation proceedings, according to the immigration lawyers.

The standard, however, is “murky”, said Adina Appelbaum, programme director of the Immigration Impact Lab at the Capital Area Immigrants’ Rights (Cair) Coalition.

As a basis for removing someone from the country, it is “concerning” because “of how broadly it can be interpreted and applied”, Ms Appelbaum said.

“More broadly, this case demonstrates the disproportionate consequences that criminal offences and allegations can have in the immigration realm, including for people who have lawful status for a green card.”

Emma Winger, a staff attorney for the American Immigration Council, said Mr Haughton’s case is unusual in that he was detained over honey, but not surprising in other respects.

“It’s not unusual that people who are held in criminal custody with ICE detainers have their detentions prolonged and then the charges are dismissed,” Ms Winger said.

Ms Winger, like Mr Morris, said the detainer for Mr Haughton probably should have been dropped when the felony drug trafficking charges disappeared.

“Once it was down to possession and not drug dealing, that seems like a good reason to drop the detainer,” Ms Winger said.

But, she added, “it’s a little bit fuzzier because in theory, all [ICE] needs to charge under this ground of inadmissibility is that they had probable cause” to believe Mr Haughton was a drug trafficker who should be barred entry.

Mr Morris said he attempted to reach ICE multiple times to get the detention order lifted but couldn’t make contact.

Both Ms Appelbaum and Ms Winger said they are not surprised.

It is generally difficult to reach someone at ICE to lift detainers for what may be considered low-priority cases, and during the shutdown, Ms Appelbaum said, “there was a lot of chaos and no responses”.

When asked about the case, customs officials directed The Washington Post to Maryland Transportation Authority Police, which directed a reporter to prosecutors in the Anne Arundel County state’s attorney’s office.

Prosecutors answered some questions about their case but directed reporters to the Department of Homeland Security over questions on Mr Haughton’s detainer.

ICE then directed reporters back to customs, where Steve Sapp, a spokesman for Customs and Border Protection, said privacy laws prohibit the agency “from discussing specifics of any individual traveller’s arrivals inspection”.

Mr Haughton recalls the emotions, the stress and the pain in his children’s voices when they spoke on the phone while he was incarcerated.

“It broke me right down,” Mr Haughton said. “Every time, they asked, ‘When are you coming home?’”

In explaining the need for two rounds of lab tests, Anne Arundel County state’s attorney Anne Colt Leitess said in an interview that the Maryland State Police crime lab is not equipped to analyse honey or liquid, so its results wouldn’t have cleared Mr Haughton.

Because the first test came up negative, she said, the state dropped the three felony drug charges but maintained the misdemeanour charge based on the police dog's findings and the positive field test while law enforcement sent the bottles to a Homeland Security lab in Georgia for more testing.

“The ICE detainer is really what is holding him,” Ms Leitess said. “He was not being held on anything with us.”

For weeks, Mr Morris emailed prosecutors asking for the status of the lab test out of Georgia.

Then, at a court hearing on 21 March – a month and a half after Mr Haughton’s third bail review and nearly three months after his initial arrest – prosecutors dropped the final charge.

Ms Leitess said her office had no control over how quickly the second test results arrived but that it dropped the last charge against Mr Haughton immediately after learning them.

Mr Haughton said he’s been trying to get his life back in order. He has a job driving a bread truck after losing his previous jobs while in jail.

And his children are trying to improve their grades after the trauma of his disappearance affected their schoolwork.

Mr Haughton says he is constantly trying to reassure his children – one of whom burst into tears when Mr Haughton came home because she didn’t recognise her father – that he isn’t going to vanish again.

But some scars, Mr Haughton said, won’t go away.

“I’m scared to even travel right now,” he said. “You’re innocent, and you can end up in jail.”",Lynh Bui,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/man-jailed-honey-jars-us-liquid-methamphetamine-a9078221.html,2019-08-25 19:54:37+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The 51-year-old is currently scheduled for execution on 20 November for the 1996 murder of Stacey Stites in Bastrop, Texas. However, new information has arisen that could potentially exonerate Reed, who was convicted by an all-white jury in 1998 (Mr Reed is black).

The petition is to rescind his death warrant and ensure he is granted a new trial.

In a statement posted on her website, Beyonce urged Texas governor Greg Abbott to take a “hard look” at the evidence that points to Reed’s innocence.

“Be honest,” she wrote. “Be fair. Give him back his life.”

Rihanna shared the petition and called on her followers to sign as well, tweeting: “One click! SIGN this petition if you don’t believe the government should kill an innocent man!”

In an article published by The New York Times, it was revealed that at least three people have come forward with new testimony regarding Ms Stites’ fiance, Jimmy Fennell – a former police officer who was released from prison in 2018. A decade earlier, he pleaded guilty to kidnapping a woman he encountered while on duty. The woman claimed he also raped her.

A sworn affidavit by a man who served a sentence in the same prison as Mr Fennell said he heard him confess to the murder of Ms Stites, and alleged that Mr Fennell bragged about killing her because she had cheated on him with a black man. Mr Fennell’s lawyer said he denies killing Ms Stites.

Mr Reed’s lawyers say witnesses have since corroborated the existence of an affair between him and Ms Stites.

His lawyers are pleading with Governor Abbott to delay the execution by 30 days, and to order the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to investigate the possibility of commuting his sentence.",Roisin O'Connor,https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/rodney-reed-death-row-execution-petition-beyonce-rihanna-meek-mill-texas-a9198031.html,"Mon, 11 Nov 2019 10:24:00 GMT","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Rodney Reed, who lawyers contend was wrongly convicted of raping and strangling 19-year-old Stacy Stites in 1996 by an all-white jury, has just seven days left to live if his appeal is not granted by Texas governor Greg Abbott.

A petition supporting his claim has been endorsed by celebrities like Beyonce, Susan Sarandon and Kim Kardashian-West and politicians on both sides of the political divide.

“One thing that I really missed was really being a father to my kids – and having an opportunity to be grandfather to my grandchildren,"" he told the Wrongful Conviction podcast.

“I just look forward to being out there with my family. With my friends, with my loved ones with my supporters"".

He added: “On November 20 the state of Texas is trying to take my life, trying to execute me – strap me to a table and inject my body with poisons. Don’t stay back and let this happen just, stay up and stay involved”.

Reed has long contended that Stites was killed by her fiancé, former police officer Jimmy Fennell – who he claims was angry after discovering his white partner was having an affair with a black man.

Mr Reed's attorneys have presented testimonies that support his claim, including one from a former prison inmate who claims Mr Fennell bragged about killing Ms Stites.

Reed's brother, Rodrick Reed, told the podcast: “I have great faith and hope and confidence that he is going to come home alive and well – I believe that. I have to believe that. I can’t put anything negative into my mind. I can’t use my energy in that way”.

The decision will come down to Governor Abbott, an ardent Republican and supporter of the death penalty who has previously referred to the punishment as “Texas justice”.

He has only spared a man’s life once while overseeing the execution of almost 50 prisoners.

But alongside celebrities and a petition signed by almost 3 million people, pressure to grant clemency is also coming from his political allies.

In a letter to Mr Abbott this week, more than a dozen Republicans said that getting it wrong with Reed could ""erode public trust — not only in capital punishment, but in Texas justice itself.""

Republican State Representative James White, who has served in the legislature for nearly a decade said: ""We have a lot of executions, right? We're Texas. This probably is the first one I've directly reached out to the attorney general's office and the governor's office on.

""Not on the prospect that I believe that Mr Reed is innocent. But I do believe there is a lot of information and evidence that does deserve to be vetted.""",Vincent Wood,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/rodney-reed-texas-death-row-execution-texas-petition-sign-retrial-case-a9201711.html,"Wed, 13 Nov 2019 17:19:00 GMT","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
776096,theindependent--2019-11-18--Sedley Alley: Man executed 13 years ago may be proven innocent by DNA,11/18/2019,theindependent,Sedley Alley: Man executed 13 years ago may be proven innocent by DNA,"Sedley Alley was strapped to a gurney and put to death in 2006, convicted of killing a 19-year-old Marine two decades earlier.

Alley had confessed to the slaying of lance corporal Suzanne Collins, but later said his confession was coerced.

Now, a nonprofit legal group dedicated to clearing the wrongly convicted hopes DNA evidence may be used to exonerate the man 13 years after his execution.

Since the early 1990s, 22 death row inmates around the US have been absolved of crimes through DNA evidence.

If the Innocence Project succeeds with Alley, it will be the first time anyone has used such evidence to exonerate a person who has already been executed.

Collins was stationed at the former Memphis Naval Air Station in Millington when she went jogging in a nearby park in July 1985.

Her body was discovered early the next day. She had been beaten, raped and mutilated.

Shortly before Alley was led to the execution chamber and given a lethal injection June 2006, Innocence Project co-founder Barry Scheck helped argue for DNA evidence testing.

But at the time, the request was denied and Alley, who had spent two decades on Tennessee's death row, was put to death at the age of 50.

That might have been the end of the story if Mr Scheck had not received a call earlier this year from investigators in St. Louis. He said they wanted to discuss a possible connection between Collins and Thomas Bruce, who is jailed in Missouri and charged with sexually assaulting two women and killing a third at a Catholic Supply store there about a year ago.

Mr Scheck said investigators had told him Bruce attended the same avionics course as Collins in Millington, Tennessee.

Mr Scheck reached out to Alley's daughter, April Alley, who agreed to petition for DNA evidence testing on behalf of her father's estate.

Along with her brother, April Alley witnessed her father's execution.

They had their hands up against the glass as he spoke his last words, telling them he loved them and to “stay strong”.

April Alley has been reluctant to talk about her effort to get DNA testing, but when she filed the petition in May, she spoke to reporters briefly.

“Watching my father die was so painful,” she said. “I'm hoping I can get the answer, one way or another, that I want.”

Shelby County Criminal Court Judge Paula Skahan heard arguments in the case last month and promised to rule on the petition Monday.

Shelby County District Attorney Amy Weirich said in an email after the petition was filed that Sedley Alley's case and conviction were repeatedly scrutinised by the courts over 21 years, and his guilt was established with “absolute certainty”.

At the hearing last month, Assistant District Attorney Steve Jones argued the state's DNA analysis law allows only the person convicted of the crime to request testing. He also argued that even if DNA from a third party were found on some of the evidence, it would not prove Alley was innocent.

Alley was convicted based on “a combination of factors that corroborated his confession,” Jones said.

Mr Scheck has said Alley's confession did not match the crime scene evidence. For example, Alley said he hit Collins with his car, but Collins hadn't been run over.

In court last month, Scheck argued that it was a matter of justice to test the DNA evidence, noting the court has the power to order the testing.

Evidence they want tested includes a pair of men's underwear recovered at the scene.

“April Alley wants to know the truth. She has the courage to seek the truth,” Mr Scheck said at the hearing. “DNA testing can ... provide that truth.”",Associated Press reporters,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/sedley-alley-death-row-innocent-execution-murder-dna-evidence-a9207686.html,"Mon, 18 Nov 2019 15:12:50 GMT","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
777257,theindependent--2019-11-26--Three innocent men released after 36 years in prison for crime they did not commit,11/26/2019,theindependent,Three innocent men released after 36 years in prison for crime they did not commit,"Three men who spent 36 years behind bars for a murder they did not commit have been released, after they managed to unearth new evidence from prison.

Alfred Chestnut, Ransom Watkins and Andrew Stewart were teenagers when they were arrested in November 1983 over the murder of 14-year-old DeWitt Duckett in Baltimore, Maryland.

The pupil was shot in the neck and killed for his Georgetown University basketball jacket while walking to a lesson at Harlem Park Junior High School.

Mr Chestnut and Mr Watkins, who were 16 at the time, and Mr Stewart, who was 17, were playing truant from another school to visit former friends and teachers at Harlem Park on the day of the killing, according to CNN.

A security guard testified that he kicked the trio out and watched them walk up the street before locking the school doors at about 12.45pm – half an hour before the shooting, the news channel reports.

The three friends were convicted of the killing based on witness testimonies and a Georgetown University jacket found in Mr Chestnut’s bedroom.

The jacket, however, reportedly had no traces of blood or gunshot residue, and Mr Chestnut’s mother had produced a receipt showing she had bought it recently.

They trio always maintained their innocence and were denied early release from prison because they refused to confess to the shooting.

The case was eventually reopened earlier this year after Mr Chestnut, who never gave up fighting for a review, filed a public records request and uncovered evidence withheld from the defence team and jury during their trial, CNN reports.

Mr Chestnut sent a letter including the new evidence to Baltimore City State attorney Marilyn Mosby’s Conviction Integrity Unit.

Prosecutors now say police reports show multiple witnesses told police that a different suspect, who was 18 at the time of the crime, was the shooter.

One student reported seeing him flee the scene and dump a gun as police arrived at the school, but authorities at the time focused their investigation on the trio.

The new suspect, who was shot dead in 2002, was also allegedly seen wearing Mr Duckett’s jacket and confessing to the murder after the shooting, another witness said.

An assistant prosecutor working on the case told the court in 1984 that the state did not have any reports that would have raised doubts about the three defendants’ guilt, even though police records had statements involving the 18-year-old and also showed trial witnesses had failed to identify the teenagers in photo line-ups.

A judge sealed those documents, but they were among the information Mr Chestnut obtained last year.

Mr Chestnut, Mr Watkins and Mr Stewart were released from custody hours after a judge cleared their convictions and prosecutors dropped the charges on Monday.

Circuit Court Judge Charles Peters told the men: “On behalf of the criminal justice system, and I’m sure this means very little to you gentlemen, I’m going to apologise”, the Baltimore Sun reported.

Ms Mosby said the result was a “tragedy”, not a “victory”.

Shawn Armbrust, executive director of the Mid-Atlantic Innocence Project, which represents Mr Watkins, said: “Everyone involved in this case – school officials, police, prosecutors, jurors, the media, and the community – rushed to judgment and allowed their tunnel vision to obscure obvious problems with the evidence.

“This case should be a lesson to everyone that the search for quick answers can lead to tragic results.”",Chiara Giordano,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/maryland-wrongful-conviction-murder-alfred-chestnut-ransom-watkins-andrew-stewart-a9218071.html,"Tue, 26 Nov 2019 11:41:57 GMT","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
781842,theintercept--2019-03-13--There Are Innocent People on Death Row Citing Wrongful Convictions California Governor Halts Ex,3/13/2019,theintercept,"“There Are Innocent People on Death Row” — Citing Wrongful Convictions, California Governor Halts Executions","signed Wednesday morning, California Gov. Gavin Newsom imposed a moratorium on executions and ordered the death chamber at San Quentin Prison — unused following a $853,000 renovation a decade ago — closed. “We are, as I speak — as I speak — shutting down, removing the equipment in the death chamber at San Quentin,” Newsom said at a press conference at the state capitol in Sacramento.

In remarks that emphasized racial disparities and the risk of executing innocent people, Newsom described his decision as the culmination of “a 40-year journey” that began when he was just a child. His grandfather introduced him to Pete Pianezzi, who came close to receiving the death penalty in 1940 after being set up by the mob. Pianezzi was eventually pardoned in 1981, at the age of 79. But wrongful convictions remain a profound danger. “You had someone just last year that was released from death row after serving 26 years in San Quentin,” he said, referring to the case of Vicente Benavides, exonerated in April 2018.

Newsom’s order leaves intact the sentences of all 737 condemned people in the state, the largest death row in the country. It also does nothing to stop prosecutors from seeking new death sentences, something California district attorneys have proven eager to do. In this sense, Newsom’s announcement merely formalizes the status quo in a state whose death penalty system has come to be defined by disarray — and where no executions have been carried out in more than 13 years.

Nevertheless, the governor’s language against the death penalty was passionate and unambiguous, suggesting that he could take more decisive action in the future. He explained that he felt no choice but to act now upon being confronted with the question of whether he would continue the efforts of the previous administration to adopt a viable lethal injection protocol. “I would be lying if I said I could support that,” he said. In addition, he said, there are 25 people on death row who have exhausted their appeals, raising the possibility that he would have to oversee their executions, something he would be unwilling to do.

Newsom’s move comes just a few years after California actually voted to hasten executions in the state. Voters in the 2016 election were faced with confusing, dueling ballot initiatives: Proposition 66, which sought to revamp the system in order to speed up executions (a measure strongly supported by law enforcement), and Proposition 62, which sought to abolish the death penalty and replace it with life without parole. Then-Gov. Jerry Brown stayed mum on the issue as did Kamala Harris, then the state’s attorney general and now a U.S. senator and Democratic candidate for president. But Newsom, at that time the state’s lieutenant governor, came out forcefully in favor of abolition, writing that the death penalty was “fundamentally immoral.” When the votes were counted, Prop 62 had failed and Prop 66 had passed by the narrowest of margins.

As predicted at the time, legal challenges have blocked the implementation of Prop 66. Today, California is one of several death penalty states where executions remain stalled with no sign of restarting. In Pennsylvania, which has not used its death chamber since 1999, Gov. Tom Wolf declared a moratorium on executions in 2015, calling the death penalty “ineffective, unjust, and expensive.” Moratoriums have also remained in place in Oregon and Colorado, two states on the cusp of abolishing executions altogether.

Even the most active death penalty states have been continually mired in controversy and litigation over execution protocols. In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine recently announced a pause on executions while the state weighs alternatives to its lethal injection protocol. The decision came soon after he granted a reprieve to Warren Keith Henness in January, citing concerns by a federal judge that the execution would be akin to torture.

In many ways, California’s death penalty system is emblematic of the state of capital punishment nationwide. As in much of the country, people on death row in the state are more likely to die from illness, suicide, or old age than they are to be executed. California’s last execution took place in January 2006, when it put to death 76-year-old Clarence Ray Allen, the oldest person ever executed by the state. Allen, who was diabetic and legally blind, was brought to the death chamber in a wheelchair. Soon after Allen’s execution, a challenge to the state’s lethal injection protocol brought the system to a halt.

Yet California prosecutors continued to seek death sentences — 180 people were sent to death row between 2006 and 2015, the last year for which the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has posted data. Since California reauthorized the death penalty in 1978, death sentences have rarely led to executions. According to data compiled by The Intercept, at least 72 people on death row have had their sentences reduced to life with or without parole and at least 11 have been released from prison, including six who were ultimately exonerated. And the row continues to gray: Fifty-three percent are 50 or older; 79 people have died awaiting execution. Twenty-six have killed themselves.

Nevertheless, prosecutors continue to insist that the death penalty is effective and necessary. The Association of Deputy District Attorneys lambasted Newsom’s order as “hasty and ill-considered,” saying that it violates the will of the people. “The voters of the State of California support the death penalty,” ADDA President Michele Hanisee said, saying that this was “powerfully demonstrated by their approval of Proposition 66 in 2016.” In an interview with The Intercept that year, Hanisee said that hastening executions was about delivering justice to victims, not about clearing the growing backlog of people awaiting execution. “I don’t think the goal is to clear death row,” she said at the time. “That would be perverse.”

News of the governor’s moratorium came as a pleasant surprise to Donald Heller, the veteran California attorney who wrote the 1978 ballot initiative that created California’s current death penalty law. Heller told The Intercept in 2016 that he was dismayed at the way the law was applied, particularly in the case of Tommy Thompson, a man executed in 1998 — and who Heller firmly believed was innocent.

Heller was in Boston and had not yet heard the news about Newsom’s planned announcement when The Intercept reached him on Tuesday night. “I applaud what he’s doing,” he said. “It shows courage and a belief that capital punishment should eventually be abolished.” Heller was an outspoken supporter of Prop 34, the predecessor to the abolitionist initiative defeated in 2016. At that time, he recalled, “it was estimated we had spent $4 billion executing 13 people, which is truly insane.” Today, the estimate has climbed to $5 billion.

Heller calls the ballot initiative he authored in the late 1970s “a colossal failure, because it didn’t function as intended.” Rather than make the death penalty apply to only the most egregious crimes, “it filled death row — and so many cases have been overturned for reasons that dealt with ineffective assistance of counsel. It’s just not effective — and I’m convinced it’s not a deterrent.”

Darryl Stallworth, a former prosecutor turned defense attorney in Oakland who campaigned for Prop 62, was “absolutely delighted” at Newsom’s decision. Stallworth came to oppose the death penalty after prosecuting a young black man in a capital case that ultimately ended with a sentence of life without parole. After 27 years working in the justice system, he has returned time and again to “the fundamental understanding that the death penalty does not deter crime, it does not save lives, it does not provide closure, it subjects people to an awful lot of disproportionate treatment based on color, class, gender,” he said. “It is a system that does not have the proper mechanisms to make sure that they get it right, and even if they do, oftentimes it’s still not constitutional.” Stallworth called capital punishment a “scar” on the nation’s laws. “I’m happy that the governor has recognized the scar, the taint, the damage that it has left on the criminal justice system.”

As Newsom made clear at the Wednesday press conference, the enduring unfairness inherent in the death penalty was what forced him to act. More than 60 percent of California’s death row population are people of color; overall, 61 percent of Californians are white. “Our death penalty system has been — by any measure — a failure,” Newsom said. “It has discriminated against defendants who are mentally ill, black and brown, or can’t afford expensive legal representation.” It does not act as a deterrent and has wasted billions, he said. “But most of all, the death penalty is absolute. Irreversible and irreparable in the event of human error.”

And there are lingering questions about the impact of human error — and of bias and corruption — in a number of California cases, including that of Kevin Cooper, who has been on death row since he was convicted in 1985 of a grisly quadruple murder in Chino Hills. There are serious reasons to question Cooper’s guilt — and to believe that he was framed by law enforcement — and he has long sought DNA testing in an effort to clear his name. But Kamala Harris refused to allow the testing during her time as attorney general — and then Jerry Brown dragged his heels until the last days of his administration, when he finally issued an executive order providing limited testing and consideration of disputed evidence. In February, Newsom widened the scope of the testing.",Jordan Smith,https://theintercept.com/2019/03/13/california-death-penalty-moratorium/,2019-03-13 20:03:18+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mark Fishwick, 49, from Northenden , failed to admit that he'd submitted fraudulent tax returns and dishonestly claimed VAT repayments.

But HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) found Fishwick deliberately stole the money to improve the cash flow of his business.

Fishwick was the company director of Ecobuild (M/C) Ltd - a commercial and residential property builder and developer.

The company was based on King Street West, in Stockport , but was liquidated in December last year.

On the Ecobuild website, the firm claim to have over '30 years of experience' with 'trusted builders'.

It emerged that between October 2016 and August 2017, Fishwick stole £49,000 in total from the taxpayer.

Fishwick, of Shawdene Road, Northenden, admitted VAT fraud and was sentenced to 18 months in jail, suspended for two years at Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court on Friday.

He was disqualified as a company director for four years and ordered to complete 250 hours of unpaid work.

Following the case, Tim Atkins, an assistant director at the Fraud Investigation Service of HMRC, said: “Fishwick used taxpayers’ money to try and keep his own business afloat. He even attempted to shift the blame to an innocent employee before accepting that it was all his doing.

“VAT fraud steals money from vital public services. This money is equivalent to the starting salary of two paramedics for a year.

Patrick McDonagh, 19, and his 18-year-old wife Shauna, died on the A40 near East Acton in West London at about 9pm on Sunday.

The car they were in was on the wrong side of the road when they were killed in a head-on collision with a coach.

A second man who was travelling in the car was taken to hospital.

Around 20 minutes earlier police had been called to reports of an aggravated burglary in Harrow and began a road chase.

But cops have now revealed the newlyweds were not present at the time of the burglary they were later linked to.

The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) has said it is understood that officers were pursuing the car, a Renault Scenic, for about 10 minutes but terminated the pursuit prior to the crash.

An IOPC statement said: ""It has now been confirmed, as part of a separate police investigation, that the occupants of the Renault were not present at the time of an aggravated burglary reported to have taken place in Harrow.""

The IOPC said its investigation would look at ""the information the police had and the rationale for the pursuit"".

A family statement said: ""Patrick and Shauna were a young couple who had recently got married and were very much in love.

""Patrick was a devoted husband to Shauna and they were very much looking forward to the birth of their daughter Sienna Marie who was due to be born on Valentine's Day.""

A National Police Air Service helicopter was tracking the Renault when it crashed.

Accounts from officers, along with footage from the helicopter, police cars, body-worn video, CCTV and in-car data are among the evidence being gathered by investigators.

The Metropolitan Police made a mandatory referral to the IOPC later on Sunday.

IOPC regional director Jonathan Green said: ""My thoughts are with the families and friends of Patrick and Shauna, those injured and all those affected by this incident.

""It is important that we now establish all of the circumstances surrounding this collision.

940633,thesun--2019-02-24--Innocent man 71 who WRONGLY spent 40 YEARS in jail for murdering his ex-girlfriend and her son win,2/24/2019,thesun,"Innocent man, 71, who WRONGLY spent 40 YEARS in jail for murdering his ex-girlfriend and her son wins £16million payout","AN innocent man who spent nearly forty years in prison for the murder of his ex- girlfriend and her son has been awarded £16 million compensation.

Craig Coley was jailed in 1978 for killing Rhonda Wicht, and her 4-year-old son, Donald, at their apartment near Los Angeles.

The 71-year-old always maintained his innocence, and was pardoned in 2017 by California’s then-governor, Jerry Brown, based on DNA evidence found by investigators.

Officials in the city of Simi Valley officials the compensation would spare Coley lengthy legal action.

""While no amount of money can make up for what happened to Mr. Coley, settling this case is the right thing to do for Mr. Coley and our community,"" said City Manager Eric Levitt.

California authorities awarded Coley £1.5 million last year - or just under £110 for each day he spent in prison – which he spent buying a home.

With the money from the final settlement he will also be able visit places on his bucket list and continue to help the wrongfully convicted, his friend Mike Bender said.

“He’s looking forward to being able to live his life. No one would want to trade places with him,” said Mr Bender, a former Simi Valley police detective.



The city's police chief and Ventura County's district attorney asked Brown to pardon him because  tests showed Coley's DNA was not on the victim's bedsheet.

The sheet contained DNA from an unknown man and Coley had an alibi for the time of the murders. Investigators later disproved testimony from an eyewitness who placed him at the scene.

His parents died while he was in prison after mortgaging their home to pay his legal bills.

Coley’s lawyer Ron Kaye said the settlement offers some closure and vindication for his client, though no amount of money can compensate him for the life he missed while imprisoned.

""He now can live the rest of his life, which we hope will be really well into the future, with the security he deserves,"" Kaye said.

Simi Valley police have not arrested anyone else in the killings.

Since his release, Coley has spoken to law enforcement officials about evidence collection, and has met with parents of prisoners who maintain their innocence.

More than 350 U.S. inmates have been exonerated by DNA testing since 1989, according to New York-based the Innocence Project, which helps people who were wrongfully convicted.

On average, convicts who were freed had served 14 years in prison when exonerated.

952874,thesun--2019-04-08--How this loving family photo cleared innocent rape suspect accused by his evil fantasist ex-girlfrie,4/8/2019,thesun,How this loving family photo cleared innocent rape suspect accused by his evil fantasist ex-girlfriend after it proved a rock-solid alibi during four-month jail hell,"THIS loving family photograph finally cleared a man who was jailed after his evil ex-partner wrongly accused him of raping her.

The picture of Dan Jones with his newborn nephew proved to be a solid alibi when Sarah Jane Parkinson claimed her partner had attacked and sexually assaulted her.

But the former prison guard endured four hellish months in a maximum security jail before the picture emerged.

Dan, of New South Wales, Australia, met Parkinson in 2011 and they got engaged after just a few months of dating.

Determined to live with his future wife, Dan bought a house and the couple moved in together.

But Parkinson, a police clerical assistant, began to concoct lies that he was violent towards her in a bid to claim their home, 9news.com.au reports.

It's alleged she told her work colleagues that her fiance was abusing her, leaving her with brusies.

But she failed to mention that she suffered a heart condition that made her dizzy, which contributed to a series of household accidents and injuries.

Dan was then called in for a ""chat"" with Parkinson's boss, Inspector Anthony Hill - and subsequently told that an Apprehended Violence Order (AVO) was being taken against him for abusing Parkinson.

Dan told 60 Minutes that Parkinson had been having an affair with a police officer she worked with.

He was targeted in a series of false allegations when Parkinson claimed she was struck by him with a lump of wood and a tyre lever.

Dan described Parkinson as being like a ""complete stranger"".

He was arrested and charged with 32 counts of domestic violence on Christmas Eve 2013.

While Dan was served with a court order, Parkinson and her new lover were living in the home he had bought.

He said: ""When I first got charged, I found out [Parkinson] had been keeping a diary of things that never happened.

""She’d written entries going back more than six months with a view to using it as a historical document in court.""

On March 21, 2014, Mr Jones was arrested at his parents' house for an alleged rape.

Parkinson said Mr Jones rammed her head into a wall, jumped on her, kicked her, forced her to open a condom wrapper, then raped her.



But he image proved that, at the time Parkinson claimed Dan had attacked her, he was actually with his brother Andrew and his partner Amy, who had visited him with their son, Hunter.

They had a photograph taken at around 1pm, with Mr Jones in his pyjamas holding baby Hunter on his knees.

The case was eventually passed to Detective Sergeant Leesa Alexander.

Parkinson accused her ex's parents of stealing her iPad before a tracking device on her car helped investigators prove she had driven up to their property and dumped the tablet on their lawn herself.

Det Alexander told 60 Minutes: ""It was clear... that Sarah had lied.""

An emergency bail hearing was called by the Department of Public Prosecutions after a series of investigations.

Dan was released from jail on bail conditions.

Early this year, Parkinson finally pleaded guilty to her crimes at court.

She was jailed for three years and one month in prison and at least two of those years will be spent behind bars.

Robert Mansfield-Hewitt, 51, was seized last year in a raid on the Airbnb-listed property near Gibraltar.

Armed police found 1.5 tonnes of hashish in an adjoining garage.

Robert, on a business trip, had been in the property for just 48 hours. He was charged with a “crime against public health” and faced four-and-a-half years in jail and a £7million fine.

 Robert, of Chichester, West Sussex, was locked up in Botafuegos prison in Algeciras.

He was eventually freed earlier this month after a judge dropped the charges. However he was still fined £1,400 for renting an unlicensed house.

Although the villa was listed with Airbnb, Robert, an MoD electrical engineer, did not book through the company.

He said: “The whole thing was a farce. They deemed me a flight risk, denied me bail and took my passport.”

Speaking of last May’s raid, the avid churchgoer, who walks with a cane due to a liver condition, said: “It was terrifying. I have never been in trouble with the law. I’m a very gentle soul, I would never get involved with drugs.”

It is understood the property’s owner, a Moroccan-born man in his 60s, has not been quizzed despite having a previous drug conviction.

Robert is due to fly back to Gatwick on Thursday. He said: “Mummy’s very pleased. We’re relieved this nightmare is over.”",Vicky Lytaki,https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/9570057/innocent-brit-spent-a-year-in-spanish-jail-after-5m-of-drugs-found-at-airbnb-villa-he-rented/,2019-07-23 23:51:20+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A Vietnam veteran and night manager at a local restaurant, Mr Coley had been involved in a relationship with Ms Wicht which had broken down. She was strangled with a rope and her son had been smothered in his bed.

1038106,thewashingtonstandard--2019-09-19--New Jersey Cops Who Fired At Innocent Man Ultimately Leading To Him Being Set On Fire Savagely B,9/19/2019,thewashingtonstandard,New Jersey:  Cops Who Fired At Innocent Man Ultimately Leading To Him Being Set On Fire & Savagely Beat Him Get No Jail,"New Jersey: Cops Who Fired At Innocent Man Ultimately Leading To Him Being Set On Fire & Savagely Beat Him Get No Jail

Jersey City, NJ — As TFTP reported in 2017, a high-speed chase in Jersey City ended when the car police were chasing crashed and turned another man’s car into a ball of flames. But it’s the chaotic insanity which followed the crash and the fire that resulted in the indictment of several Jersey City police officers and a massive lawsuit against the city and the department.

This week, however, all of the officers involved took plea deals and although they were fired, not a single one of them will go to jail for what they did.

The taxpayers will now be held liable as the innocent victim of gross police negligence and brutality, Miguel Feliz, has filed a $25 million claim against Jersey city and its police department for excessive force used on him in the June 4th incident. Feliz has been unable to return to work since police caused his car to be set on fire, in turn, setting Feliz on fire, and then brutally attacking him.

As TFTP reported, the group of New Jersey police officers involved were indicted, including two for attempted murder, after they were caught on camera kicking Feliz as he crawled from the burning wreckage of a crash involving the pursuit of Leo Pinkston.

The officers all faced a slew of charges each:

However, none of these charges stuck and they will escape almost all accountability. According to NorthJersey.com, officers Eric Kosinski and Francisco Rodriguez each pleaded guilty to endangering another person. Kosinski, Rodriguez and Khan each fired their weapons during the pursuit.

All four former officers are barred from future law enforcement employment.

“This agreement is substantive in that it provides accountability for the actions of the police officers while at the same time taking into account the input of the victim,” Hudson County Prosecutor Esther Suarez said in a statement. “It is the most fair and just resolution in a difficult case.”

Ask Feliz — whose body is covered in third-degree burns and whose face was kicked in by police boots as fire engulfed his body — if he thinks this is “the most fair and just resolution.”

As we reported at the time, Jersey City police were pursuing Pinkston, 48, on the night of June 4, 2017, and had attempted to kill him by firing rounds into his vehicle. He fled, but crashed into another car which was pushed into a telephone pole.

The car Pinkston crashed into then caught on fire. The innocent man inside the car—Feliz—was able to escape the flames, but not without injury. His clothes and skin were burning.

As Feliz scrambles to take off his burning clothes as he gets out of the fire, a bystander named Erik Roberto was filming the scene. Roberto screamed to the police, “Oh no…no…Help him out! Help him out!”

But they did the exact opposite.

“They didn’t help him. They just started kicking him and dragging him…I don’t think they treated him in the right way and that’s not how you treat any human being in this world,” Roberto lamented to reporters.

After police rapidly approached the man, with guns drawn, they began kicking him in the ribs and head, apparently mistaking him for Pinkston. It was only after kicking and beating him that they then decided to drag him away from the flames of the burning vehicle.

The actions of the officers are considered abhorrent by Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop who told reporters at the time, “I don’t think there’s any explanation that would justify their actions…The entire pursuit that was previous to that fiery crash had questionable judgment calls by the officers, from the shootings to continuing to pursue the car…”

Laughably and predictably, the Jersey City Police Officers Benevolent Association (JCPOBA) president Carmine Disbrow issued a statement defending the actions of its officers that day.

We at The Free Thought Project beg to differ. The video clearly shows officers, who would have to have been blind not to see a burning man, go up and kick him like a junkyard dog and drag his body like a dead corpse across the pavement.

Feliz now lives in West NY. His father said he suffered severe burns and spent many days in the burn unit in the hospital. He also sustained fractured ribs and has been left permanently disfigured.

His father called the actions of the officers an attempted “massacre” and said he’d just left home to go to work when the accident and beating took place.

The entire incident serves to illustrate how police officers treat individuals they suspect as having committed crimes. No longer are suspects innocent until proven guilty. All too often, as TFTP has tirelessly reported, cops comport themselves as judge, jury, and executioners.",Matt Agorist,https://thewashingtonstandard.com/new-jersey-cops-who-fired-at-innocent-man-ultimately-leading-to-him-being-set-on-fire-savagely-beat-him-get-no-jail/,2019-09-19 15:01:07+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1038181,thewashingtonstandard--2019-09-29--Mississippi Cops Go To Wrong Home Execute Innocent Man Claim It Was OK Because He Had No Const,9/29/2019,thewashingtonstandard,Mississippi:  Cops Go To Wrong Home – Execute Innocent Man – Claim It Was OK Because He Had No Constitutional Rights,"Mississippi: Cops Go To Wrong Home – Execute Innocent Man – Claim It Was OK Because He Had No Constitutional Rights

Southaven, MS — Two years ago, police responding to a call of domestic violence went to the wrong home and killed an innocent husband. A year later, the tragedy grew deeper when TFTP learned that the officers involved in the killing would not be charged. Now, two years later, we are finding that the government is trying to dismiss the family’s lawsuit, claiming that Ismael Lopez had no Constitutional rights, therefore, his murder did not matter.

In July of 2018, the officers who killed Lopez were brought to a grand jury by District Attorney John Champion who attempted to get them indicted on charges of homicide. However, the grand jury irresponsibly failed to return an indictment.

“The grand jury was given all of the evidence and they decided not to indict,” Champion said. “From my perspective, the case is closed at this point.”

Now, according to a document filed by the City of Southaven Tuesday, the city is attempting to justify the murder and dismiss the lawsuit by claiming Lopez has no rights because he was an undocumented immigrant.

Lopez’s family attorneys Murray Wells and Aaron Neglia responded to the filing, calling the policy “ludicrous,” according to WMC5. Wells explained to the news outlet that he’s never seen anything like this before, and neither have we.

“The city announced their policy is that undocumented residents have no constitutional protection,” Wells said. “This is an attempt to chip away at our constitution.”

Wells correctly stated that any person on US soil is subject to the constitution and the Supreme Court has well established this. Otherwise, Wells said using their justification, “Stormtroopers can kill you without any […] repercussions.”

Indeed, that is the case. If the state can simply claim, post-murder, that the person they killed had no rights, what exactly is there a legal system for in the first place?

What’s more, Lopez was actually married to a legal citizen and had lived in the neighborhood for 16 years.

“Everything about this is wrong. I am outraged. Shame, shame on the police department, shame on the DA. Mr. Champion, shame on you. You need to retire,” Pastor Rolando Rostro, Lopez family advocate, said last year.

As TFTP reported at the time, in July of 2017, Ismael Lopez and his wife were the only ones home when Ismael heard his dogs barking, so he took a look outside to see what was going on. Seconds later, he would be shot and killed by people who claim to protect society. Police had no right to be there and had gone to the wrong address.

The Southaven Police Department admitted officers went to the wrong house that fateful night. According to police, they were trying to serve a warrant for domestic assault to Samuel Pearman—who lives 36 feet away from Lopez’s home.

Police claim that when Lopez came to the door, he pointed a gun at them. However, multiple bullets were fired through the closed door and Champion admitted that the autopsy showed Lopez died from a gunshot wound to the back of the head.

According to WMC 5, three officers were at the scene, but only one of them opened fire. That officer fired six total shots—two at a dog that ran out of Lopez’s house toward the officers and four into the house. The bullets went through Lopez’s front door; one hit him in the back of the head. Lopez’s dog was grazed by a bullet.

“I do not believe [the officers] identified themselves at the door,” Champion said.

Champion said Lopez was pulling the gun away from the direction of the officers when the officers opened fire. He said he did not want to speculate about how it happened, but he thought Lopez could have been shot in the back of the head while he turned away from the officers, reports WMC 5.

The autopsy would later prove this to be true.

None of the officers were wearing a body camera nor was any of the incident recorded on dash camera.

The federal lawsuit filed by the family is seeking $20 million. City officials said they are ready to “vigorously defend our officers and city in a court of law.” …because officers who shoot innocent people in the back of the head after going to the wrong home, need defending.

All the officers involved have since returned to full duty, including the one who killed Lopez.

As the Free Thought Project has reported numerous times, entirely innocent people are often shot or killed by police at the wrong home. The innocent home owner comes to the door with a gun to see who the intruders are and bang, they are met with a hail of gunfire from cops who failed to check their GPS before assaulting completely innocent people.

Sadly, as it seems, none of the officers involved in this case will be charged as TFTP reported last year, cops can go to the wrong house, kill the innocent homeowner and face no charges.

A disturbing precedent was set in March of 2017 in a federal appeals court which ruled in favor of police who knocked on the wrong door at 1:30 am, failed to identify themselves, and then repeatedly shot the innocent homeowner until he died.

The homeowner, 26-year-old Andrew Scott had committed no crime when officers came to his home that night on July 15, 2012.

“Government officials insist that there is nothing unlawful, unreasonable or threatening about the prospect of armed police dressed in SWAT gear knocking on doors in the middle of night and ‘asking’ homeowners to engage in warrantless ‘knock-and-talk’ sessions,” said constitutional attorney John W. Whitehead, president of The Rutherford Institute and author of Battlefield America: The War on the American People. “However, as Andrew Scott learned, there’s always a price to pay for saying no to such heavy-handed requests by police. If the courts continue to sanction such aggressive, excessive, coercive ‘knock-and-shoot’ tactics, it will give police further incentive to terrorize and kill American citizens without fear of repercussion.”

In the land of the free, those who claim they have sworn to protect you, can come to your house and kill you, and face no consequences by claiming you have no rights. This is why police in America kill more citizens than anywhere in the rest of the world. This is why people protest. This is why people are angry.",Matt Agorist,https://thewashingtonstandard.com/mississippi-cops-go-to-wrong-home-execute-innocent-man-claim-it-was-ok-because-he-had-no-constitutional-rights/,2019-09-29 13:23:49+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1038364,thewashingtonstandard--2019-11-01--Colorado: Innocent Man’s Home Destroyed After SWAT Shows Up In Search Of Clothing Shoplifter – Court,11/1/2019,thewashingtonstandard,Colorado: Innocent Man’s Home Destroyed After SWAT Shows Up In Search Of Clothing Shoplifter – Court Says He’s Owed No Compensation,"Colorado: Innocent Man’s Home Destroyed After SWAT Shows Up In Search Of Clothing Shoplifter – Court Says He’s Owed No Compensation

A federal appeals court ruled this week that an innocent Colorado man is owed no compensation after a SWAT team literally blew up and tore out sections of his house following the illegal entrance into his home of a suspected clothing shoplifter.

Leo Lech sued Greenwood police after they fired gas munition and 40-millimeter rounds through the windows of his home in the June 2015 during a 19-hour standoff with the shoplifter who illegally entered his home and barricaded himself inside.

The damages and replacement costs total nearly $400,000, according to Lech.

First, take a look at the damage.

If using all those explosive and rounds weren’t enough, the police actually drove an armored vehicle through the doors and tossed in several flashbang grenades and detonated explosives.

Seriously, this is in a neighborhood and over a clothing shoplifter! Who is training these guys? Or should I say, who is indoctrinating them to think they are in a war zone?

According to the Washington Post, after the suspect was apprehended, it left Leo Lech’s son, John, without a home. John lived there with his girlfriend and her 9-year-old son.

However, seeing the damage, you would think the police and the city would have taken responsibility, but they didn’t.

They insulted the Lech’s by refusing to compensate them and then insulting them by offering them $5,000 in temporary rental assistance and for the insurance deductible.

Now, after the Leches sued, a federal appeals court has decided what else the city owes the Lech family for destroying their house more than four years ago: nothing.

On Tuesday, a three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit unanimously ruled that the city is not required to compensate the Lech family for their lost home because it was destroyed by police while they were trying to enforce the law, rather than taken by eminent domain.

The Lechs had sued under the Fifth Amendment’s Takings Clause, which guarantees citizens compensation if their property is seized by the government for public use. But the court said that Greenwood Village was acting within its “police power” when it damaged the house, which the court said doesn’t qualify as a “taking” under the Fifth Amendment. The court acknowledged that this may seem “unfair,” but when police have to protect the public, they can’t be “burdened with the condition” that they compensate whomever is damaged by their actions along the way.

“It just goes to show that they can blow up your house, throw you out on the streets and say, ‘See you later. Deal with it,’ ” Leo Lech said in an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday. “What happened to us should never happen in this country, ever.”

Now, Lech is contemplating taking his case to the supreme Court of the united States.

Greenwood Village spokeswoman Melissa Gallegos applauded the 10th Circuit’s ruling saying, “The house was being used as a barricade, and the damage done to it was to remove the barricade and get the gunman out without any loss of life. That is not a use of another’s property under eminent domain, but a use of another’s property during a police emergency.”

A police emergency? The took a tank in there! They were setting off explosives!

Robert Jonathan Seacat, had stolen a shirt and a couple of belts from a Walmart. He was attempting to steal the Lech’s car when police arrived at the house when officers claimed in an affidavit that he fired at them with a handgun.

And for 19 hours, he was held up inside the home.

“They proceed to destroy the house — room by room, by room, by room,” Lech said. “This is one guy with a handgun. This guy was sleeping. This guy was eating. This guy was just hanging out in this house. I mean, they proceeded to blow up the entire house.”

“There was one gunman with a handgun and they chose to turn this house into something that resembles Osama Bin Laden’s compound,” he said.

“They methodically fired explosives into every room in this house in order to extract one person” Lech continued. “Granted, he had a handgun, but against 100 officers?”

“You know, the proper thing to do would be to evacuate these homes around here, ensure the safety of the homeowners around here, fire some tear gas through the windows,” he added. “If that didn’t work, you have 50 SWAT officers with body armor break down the door.”

That does seem a lot more logical and quite a bit safer, but what Mr. Lech doesn’t understand is these guys have all these new weapons of war, as certain gun grabbers say that shouldn’t be on our streets, that they need to play with. Notice who the state protects when those are used in such a manner? That’s right, their agents. They could care less for the homeowner.

Speaking of his home, Lech said, “It survived two World Wars, OK, but it didn’t survive the American police paramilitary operation,”

Of course, the police merely issued words and not real sympathy over the matter.

“My mission is to get that individual out unharmed and make sure my team and everyone else around including the community goes home unharmed,” Greenwood Village Police Commander Dustin Varney said in 2015, KUSA reported. “Sometimes that means property gets damaged, and I am sorry for that.”

Wow! Honestly, this is just pure tyranny and incompetence. Varney’s mission is to keep the peace, not disturb it in such a fashion, and with no remorse for what they did to the Lech’s home, the devastation the family endured and I would imagine the high premiums they were forced to pay following Varney and his team’s weekend warriors party.

1038366,thewashingtonstandard--2019-11-01--Kansas: Taypayers To Be Held Liable After SWAT Raids Innocent Family Over Growing Tomato Plants,11/1/2019,thewashingtonstandard,Kansas: Taypayers To Be Held Liable After SWAT Raids Innocent Family Over Growing Tomato Plants,"Leawood, KS — Adlynn and Robert Harte and their two children had harmed no one and broken no laws when heavily armed militarized SWAT deputies with the Johnson County sheriff’s department stormed their home like it was an ISIS compound. The “hero” deputies were searching for evidence of marijuana production and use but they found none because the Harte’s don’t use or produce marijuana. They do grow vegetables, however, and they also drink tea.

The Hartes and their two children were held at gunpoint and nearly killed for purchasing supplies for their vegetable garden and drinking tea. After they were seen buying gardening supplies, cops rummaged through their trash and mistook tea leaves for weed, sparking ‘probable cause’ for the raid. Since the raid in 2012, the Harte family has been attempting to seek justice but to no avail. This month, however, they finally got a break.

According to Reason, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit ruled that Adlynn and Robert Harte, who lost their case after a jury trial in 2017, were wrongly denied the opportunity to pursue several of their claims against the Johnson County sheriff’s deputies who stormed into their home as part of a comically inept publicity stunt.

In the realm of unlawful police raids, this one may take the cake. It began with a Missouri State Highway Patrolman staking out a garden store every day in Kansas City in hopes of catching some pot growers. Robert Harte visited the store with his two children to buy supplies for an educational vegetable garden project in his basement.

The sergeant shared Harte’s information with a counterpart in the Johnson County Sheriff’s Office (JCSO), which was planning to raid several suspected cannabis growers on 4/20…such originality. JCSO went through the Harte’s trash on three occasions, eventually finding what officers believed was cannabis clippings soaked in THC extract. Because everyone throws away their weed, right?

But the “marijuana” was actually discarded tea leaves.

Despite a lab technician saying the tea leaves looked nothing like cannabis leaves or stems, deputies Edward Blake and Mark Burns used notoriously faulty field drug test kits which showed the presence of THC. These supposed field drug tests were the basis for planning the raid, but the deputies never photographed or documented the tests — leading Judge Carlos Lucero to note that these circumstances gave the deputies strong motive to lie.

“The deputies did not photograph any of the substances, nor did they send them to a crime lab for testing,” Judge Joel Carson notes in this month’s 10th Circuit decision. “If the deputies would have sent the wet vegetation to a crime lab for testing, they would have discovered that the wet vegetation was not marijuana but instead was Addie’s loose-leaf tea. Rather than conducting further investigation, the deputies prepared a search warrant affidavit relying solely on the loose-leaf tea found in the garbage and Bob’s shopping trip to a garden store eight months earlier.”

They had to find something on the Hartes, because the JCSO had already scheduled the raid on the Harte’s home. Several routine investigatory steps were ignored, making their search warrant “based on nothing more than gardening supplies and a bag and wet tea leaves in the garbage.”

The list of sheer incompetence goes on. In his written decision in 2017, Lucero used extraordinary language to characterize just how reckless these drug warriors were.

During the two and a half hour raid – where heavily armed SWAT team broke in during early morning hours while the children were home – officers frantically searched for anything to justify their debacle, but found only tomato plants and gardening supplies. Knowing the history of no-knock SWAT raids, someone could have easily gotten killed.

The cops had picked the wrong target this time, as both Mr. and Mrs. Harte are former CIA employees and knew a thing or two about research. After the traumatic experience, the Hartes set out to find out why this happened to them. Spending thousands of dollars in legal costs, they were able to procure a probable-cause affidavit.

It was easy to see that the “probable cause” was full of holes, and thankfully the 10th Circuit court actually studied the facts. The reinstated lawsuit includes unlawful search-and-seizure claims against 10 deputies, the sheriff who started the fiasco and the Johnson County Board of Commissioners.

The Hartes can also move forward with trying to prove that the cops lied about the field tests, and other claims under state law including trespass, assault and false imprisonment.

According to Reason, in its new decision, the 10th Circuit says the district court erred in limiting the Hartes to that one federal claim two years ago. The court has again remanded the case, saying the Hartes should be allowed to pursue three other claims: “(1) whether Defendants properly executed the warrant; (2) whether the deputies exceeded the scope of the warrant by searching for evidence of general criminal activity; and (3) whether the deputies prolonged Plaintiffs’ detention, thus subjecting them to an illegal arrest.”

“There was no probable cause at any step of the investigation,” wrote Lucero in 2017. “Not at the garden shop, not at the gathering of the tea leaves, and certainly not at the analytical stage when the officers willfully ignored directions to submit any presumed results to a laboratory for analysis.”",Matt Agorist,https://thewashingtonstandard.com/kansas-taypayers-to-be-held-liable-after-swat-raids-innocent-family-over-growing-tomato-plants/,"Fri, 01 Nov 2019 16:14:25 +0000","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1038759,thewashingtonstandard--2019-12-15--Texas:  Cop Found Guilty After Video Caught Him Beating Innocent Man In A Hospital & Lying About It,12/15/2019,thewashingtonstandard,Texas:  Cop Found Guilty After Video Caught Him Beating Innocent Man In A Hospital & Lying About It,"Fort Worth, TX — The body camera video showing a Fort Worth police officer viciously attack and then falsely arrest an innocent man was so terrible that it actually led to this cop getting charged. However, it left many asking why it took more than a year to indict this cop knowing that investigators had video evidence of the attack the entire time. Now, however, this abusive cop has been found guilty and will be held accountable for his crimes.

“He lied about the facts and circumstances. He lied in his police report. He said that he had been told multiple times to leave. He said in his police report that he told him he was under arrest before he struck him,” said Prosecutor Terri Moore.

The victim in this incident was then-20-year-old Henry Newson who’d just been released from the hospital. As he was waiting for his mom to come pick him up, officer Jon Preston Romer, 38, who was working as security at the hospital, walked up to Newson and began to attack him for no reason.

The subsequent attack led to a lawsuit by Newson and a criminal investigation into Romer.

In spite of the incident happening in 2016, the body camera footage was only just released last year after Romer was indicted. Infuriatingly enough, up until Wednesday, Romer was still collecting a paycheck as a police officer. He was only fired after he was found guilty. In March, he was indicted on charges of official oppression, aggravated perjury and making a false report to a police officer in connection with the incident.

This week, he was only found guilty on the aggravated perjury charge and the other charges are still pending.

Sentencing for this charge has not been announced. Romer faces up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine for this third-degree felony.

As the Star-Telegram reported at the time:

Newson, who according to his lawsuit had just spent two days in the hospital for an illness and was waiting for a ride home, was charged with resisting arrest and criminal trespass, but those were dismissed in March 2017 at prosecutorial discretion. The video shows Romer putting Newson in a headlock and taking him to the ground. Then Romer and two other men named in the lawsuit as hospital security guards Jeremy Flores and Jonathan Walterbach appear to pile on top of Newson and punch, kick and handcuff him.

Surveillance video obtained by Newson’s attorney shows Newson borrowing someone’s phone to call his mother when hospital security approaches him. “I’m just trying to figure out what you’re doing,” a security guard said. “They’re picking me up from here,” Newson explained at one point. “I have nowhere to go.”

At no time does Newson ever pose a threat to anyone around him. However, as the conversation escalates, Romer comes in for the kill.

Newson refers to Romer as “bro” and the officer then punches him the jaw and takes him down. Remarkably enough, Newson never fought back and instead tried to get help from the officers, but they did not help.

“The officers knew why he was there, he complied with everything they asked him to do, and they still beat him up,” his attorney, Matthew Bobo said.

“This was a young African American kid with no criminal history, no criminal record,” said Bobo. “He’d been in the hospital for two days and he was waiting for his mom to come pick him up.”

Newson’s arrest and beating sparked protest among anti-police brutality activists in the community. Michael Bell, pastor of Greater St. Stephen First Church and spokesman for the Tarrant County Local Organizing Committee, asked during a news conference last year why Romer — who Bell noted fatally shot a black man during a traffic stop in front of three of his children in 2011 — was not fired, according to the Telegram.

“Why was a police officer who has used deathly force been allowed to remain on the streets until the day of his indictment?” Bell said. “Who made the decision to not hold Romer accountable for his actions once they were uncovered?”

Had they held him accountable, Newson would have never been assaulted.

According to the Telegram, the victim in the 2011 shooting death was 32-year-old handicapped father Charal “Ra Ra” Thomas. Thomas did not follow police orders to exit his vehicle and drove off with Romer’s arm trapped in a window. Thomas continued to drive, dragging Romer along until Romer pulled himself onto a running board and fatally shot him in front of three of Thomas’ children. That death became a source of friction between police and the black community.

Because his department never held him accountable for the shooting death of an unarmed handicapped father, this problem cop was allowed to go on brutalizing innocent people. Finally, he was caught.",Matt Agorist,https://thewashingtonstandard.com/texas-cop-found-guilty-after-video-caught-him-beating-innocent-man-in-a-hospital-lying-about-it/,"Sun, 15 Dec 2019 13:02:26 +0000","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1038818,thewashingtonstandard--2019-12-22--New York:  Cops Frame Innocent Brothers For Cocaine – Tried To Destroy Video Evidence – It Survived ,12/22/2019,thewashingtonstandard,New York:  Cops Frame Innocent Brothers For Cocaine – Tried To Destroy Video Evidence – It Survived (Video),"New York, NY — To all those who make the bogus claim of “if you don’t do anything wrong, you have nothing to worry about,” consider the following case as even more evidence of how ridiculous that assertion is. Two innocent brothers were framed by NYPD cops who were caught on video destroying video evidence of their egregious act. Luckily for the brothers, the hard drive in the video recorder survived and it caught these badged criminals in the act.

Earlier this year, apparent criminals with the NYPD’s gang unit executed a search warrant on a store owned by two brothers. The entrepreneurs had committed no crime, were conducting 100% legal business, yet they were kidnapped by officers and caged for over a month on false charges.

The cops accused the brothers of having a large amount of cocaine and when they were booked into jail, the DA’s office provided no documentation and asked for the two brothers to be held without bail.

“It was the worst day of my life,” said one of the brothers, who asked not to be identified by name, according to NBC 4. “We never had drugs in the store,” he added.

Highlighting the level of criminality associated with this raid is the fact that the cops used the notoriously faulty field test kits to test the “cocaine.” As TFTP has reported on numerous occasions, tens of thousands have been convicted and served time for crimes they didn’t commit because the cases against them relied on horribly unreliable field drug test kits. So prone to errors are the tests, courts won’t allow their submission as evidence. However, they are continued to be used by law enforcement, needlessly ruining thousands of lives.

This time, however, the test kits showed that the substance tested was not drugs. Yes, you read that correctly. The cheap faulty kit actually returned a negative result for cocaine, but the cops arrested the innocent brothers anyway and had them locked up without bail.

The brothers would spend over a month in jail before lab tests for cocaine came back negative. All the charges were then dropped, but their lives and business had been ruined by their absence. When the brothers finally went back to their store, they found that cops had left behind the field test kits — which all showed negative results. That wasn’t the only thing cops left behind either. As NBC New York reports:

Attorney Marvyn Kornberg, a criminal attorney who represents the brothers, said, “It’s a unit gone wild, that’s what it says to me. They think they’re above the law. They’re ripping out cameras. What are they afraid of the public seeing?”

Naturally, the NYPD, who claims this incident is “under investigation,” said they destroyed the cameras for “tactical” reasons.

“That’s ridiculous,” said Richard Rivera, a former police officer in West New York, New Jersey, who is now a police tactics expert, according to NBC 4.

“They could have covered the cameras. The way they come in doesn’t indicate that any of them is concerned about a remote feed. They’re not worried about security. It’s like a walk in the park to them,” he said, noting that there is no legitimate reason to destroy evidence in that manner.

“This whole incident is a huge mess for them,” he said. “If this is an ongoing drug case, they would want to preserve the evidence, not destroy it, and that’s exactly what they did.”

When asked why they would recommend no bail for the brothers, the DA’s officer pointed the finger back at the NYPD, saying they relied on their word that the claims were true. Unfortunately for the brothers, this blind trust in badged criminals would land them in a cage for over a month.

To date, the brothers still have no idea why these criminals from the NYPD showed up at their store that day. As part of their lawsuit against the city, they have demanded prosecutors turn over the underlying basis for the search warrant. They have also filed a notice of claim to sue the city and the taxpayers will undoubtedly be held liable for these criminal cops.",Matt Agorist,https://thewashingtonstandard.com/new-york-cops-frame-innocent-brothers-for-cocaine-tried-to-destroy-video-evidence-it-survived-video/,"Sun, 22 Dec 2019 13:39:48 +0000","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1045683,trueactivist--2019-02-12--Florida Cop Purposely Botches Roadside Drug Test And Arrests An Innocent Man But Is Caught On Video,2/12/2019,trueactivist,"Florida Cop Purposely Botches Roadside Drug Test And Arrests An Innocent Man, But Is Caught On Video","Police body camera footage shows a Florida sheriff purposely botching the results of a roadside drug test during a traffic stop, and then arresting an innocent man.

The video which was obtained by Reason and filmed last April 17, 2018, shows Florida resident Steve Vann being stopped on the road during a routine traffic stop by former Jackson County Sheriff’s deputy Zachary Wester. The police searched the vehicle and Wester pulls out a small plastic from the center console to test it for methamphetamines using the Nark II field test. As per the manufacturer of the field test, the results “will develop an immediate (within 2 seconds) Dark Blue color as a positive reaction after breakage and agitation of the 3rd ampoule. If the color development is an immediate Pink slowly transforming to Lavender, you do not have either Methamphetamine or MDMA.”

Although the results of this small plastic bag clearly turned red, as seen in the footage, Wester claimed it was ‘blue’ and pressured Vann to admit that he had knowledge of the methamphetamine found inside his car. Vann continued to deny this and was even brought to tears at several points. As a result of this routine traffic stop, Vann was charged with possession of drugs and paraphernalia.

Wester has had a history of bad policing, since he was hired in 2016. State prosecutors have dropped more than 100 cases where this infamous sheriff was involved in, after another camera footage was released last September 2018, which showed the officer allegedly planting drugs in yet another car. Included in the 100 dropped cases was Vann’s charge. Wester was fired immediately after this incident.

More than a dozen of Wester’s victims have filed federal lawsuits against him. Many of his chosen victims had prior criminal records due to drug possession, which made them easy targets. No one wold believe their world against a Sheriff’s word. All charges would likely stand if Wester had not been seen in the camera footages and he would still be patrolling the streets of Florida.

235329,hitandrun--2019-07-18--Corey Atchison Freed After Serving 28 Years for a Murder He Didnt Commit,7/18/2019,hitandrun,Corey Atchison Freed After Serving 28 Years for a Murder He Didn't Commit,"After 28 years in prison, Corey Atchison is finally a free man.

Convicted of murder in 1991, the Oklahoma native spent nearly three decades behind bars before a private investigator, Eric Cullen, took up his case. Cullen's work had previously helped to free Atchison's younger brother, Malcolm Scott, who was wrongfully convicted of murder in 1994. In Scott's case, another man who had testified against Scott eventually confessed to the murder before being executed for another crime. In Atchison's, evidence emerged that the authorities had bullied witnesses into offering false testimony.

District Judge Sharon Holmes found that his case was marred by a ""fundamental miscarriage of justice,"" according to people who were in the courtroom and local reports…. ""Corey was arrested three months before his daughter was born; this is the first time he's been able to have some real contact with her and the same with his 10-year-old grandson,"" his lawyer Joseph Norwood told The Washington Post. ""I'm very proud to have vindicated them and reunited them.""

One might have expected Atchison to express bitterness. (If I had been wrongly imprisoned for nearly 30 years of my life, I would be plotting some kind of elaborate revenge, Count of Monte Cristo–style.) But Atchison told the press that he felt ""blessed"" and held no grudges. ""Life's too short,"" he said.

Indeed, life is too short. And Atchison's life is 30 years shorter, because overzealous authorities stole that time from him.

I can't help but think about this travesty of justice in the context of the current national freakout many on the right are having with respect to ""Big Tech,"" globalization, automation, and the supposed sins of the free market. To grapple with these issues, these conservatives are racing to embrace nationalism and ""declare independence from neoliberalism, from libertarianism, from what they call classical liberalism…from the set of ideas that sees the atomic individual, the free and equal individual, as the only thing that matters in politics."" That's how author Yoram Hazony explained it during his remarks at the National Conservatism Conference in Washington, D.C., this week. (See my colleague Stephanie Slade's excellent writeup of the event.) Other speakers at the conference explicitly singled out private companies like Google, Amazon, and Facebook as bigger threats to individual liberty than big government. Libertarians, the new nationalists say, are fools for caring more about the latter threat than the former.

For the likes of Steven Crowder and Dennis Prager, perhaps the threat of YouTube censorship really is the most serious tyranny they face. Many other Americans have different problems. Neither Google nor Amazon nor any social media company even existed when the government sent Atchison to prison for for 28 years. Who knows if one day Twitter would have shadowbanned Eric Garner, killed by the cops because he was selling loose cigarettes? On Tuesday, the Justice Department announced that none of the officers responsible would face charges. The only person who went to prison in the Garner case was Ramsey Orta—a friend of Garner's who managed to record his final moments.

Giving more power to the government is probably not an appealing agenda for the family of Daniel Shaver, whose killer—Officer Philip Mitchell Brailsford—will receive $2,500 a month because he allegedly got PTSD for shooting the unarmed man in a hotel hallway. Nor would it please the Lowthers, who spent $300,000 trying to stop Child Protective Services from abducting their children based on a mendacious lie.

Our critics—be they nationalist conservatives or progressive liberals—say we libertarians are monomaniacally focused on reducing the size of government. But that's because we recognize that government has more power than any other institution to kill people, deport their relatives, kidnap their children, and destroy their livelihoods. If you're not at serious risk of suffering one of those calamities, you possess a level of privilege many of your fellow Americans do not.

That doesn't mean you are forbidden from complaining about bias or mistreatment at the hands of private organizations such as tech companies and the mainstream media. I'm frequently critical of both myself. But you should be really, really wary of supporting robust federal intervention into these problems, when the likely result will be to give government authorities more resources for oppressing everyone.

The next time someone says that there's no bigger threat to Americans' liberties than Big Tech, remember Corey Atchison.",Robby Soave (robby.soave@reason.com),http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/reason/HitandRun/~3/1ZfAIQ5aK80/,2019-07-18 15:35:02+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
316146,mercurynews--2019-11-13--SoCal man freed after 11 years for robberies he didn’t commit,11/13/2019,mercurynews,SoCal man freed after 11 years for robberies he didn’t commit,"In 2008 Ruben Martinez Jr. was sentenced to 47 years and eight months in prison for a series of armed robberies, even though he was at work when two of the crimes were committed.

Eleven years later, he finally proved his innocence.

The 49-year-old was freed this month after serving 11 years of that sentence. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge William Ryan vacated Martinez’s conviction, permanently released him from prison, dismissed his case with prejudice and found him factually innocent of the crimes for which he was convicted.

“I did not do this time by myself,” Martinez said at a news conference. “My family did time. My wife did time with me, did the 11 years with me. I couldn’t do it on my own, by my own strength. It was God’s strength that got me through this.”

Martinez and his wife Maria always insisted that he was not the armed robber who hit the same Los Angeles auto body shop five times between 2005 and 2007.

“All my husband wanted was for the truth to be revealed. Well, the truth has been revealed, and he’s a free man,” Maria Martinez told reporters.

He was convicted without physical evidence

 Martinez worked for a temporary employment agency at the time of the crimes and said he was working when two of the robberies occurred, according to court documents.

But a witness identified him as the perpetrator and he was convicted in 2008 on nine counts of second-degree robbery. There was no physical evidence linking him to the crimes.

Martinez was tried a second time on the charges after his first trial ended in a mistrial. Two witnesses who testified that he was not the robber were not called in the second trial, according to the District Attorney’s office.

Martinez said he turned down a plea deal that would have included a 2 1/2 year sentence.

He filed several unsuccessful appeals before bringing his case to the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Conviction Review Unit.

District Attorney Jackie Lacey told reporters that her investigators were able to track down new information that confirmed Martinez’s alibi. She said the alibis were not fully presented at trial.

“They painstakingly tracked down witnesses and uncovered employment records and pay stubs that confirmed that Mr. Martinez could not have committed two of the crimes that were clearly the work of the same serial robber,” she said at a news conference.

Lacey said that the robberies were all committed by the same person, who has not been caught, so Martinez had to be innocent of those crimes as well.

She ordered him to be released November 1 and he was freed four days later.

“I am sorry for this injustice and I am so happy that you did not give up on us and allowed us to share this moment,” Lacey told the Martinez family.

She said that during Martinez’s years in prison, the couple was “unstoppable in their pursuit of his freedom.”

“Throughout this terrible ordeal, The two were never deterred by setbacks and instead demonstrated remarkable strength and dignity through what I imagine must have been a dark time,” Lacey said.

His wife worked on his appeal

Maria Martinez had worked as a secretary in the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department and was very close with retired homicide detective Catherine Wills — so close that Wills’ husband gave Maria away when she married Ruben.

“She is such a beautiful person and I knew that Maria would never have anything to do with a person who committed crimes, she’s so straight,” Wills said.

Wills said that she and Maria Martinez spent six months going through every document in Ruben Martinez’s case and presented a thick binder of evidence to the district attorney’s office.

“I told them, ‘Look, I’m 82 years old now, and I’m not going to die until Ruben Martinez is out of prison,'” Wills said.

“I just pinch myself every morning,” Wills told CNN affiliate KABC. “I knew it should happen, but that doesn’t mean it does happen.”

Martinez is the third person to have their sentence vacated since Lacey formed the unit in 2015 and the first to do it without an attorney, according to the district attorney’s office. There are currently 45 cases under review.
• Trump says he is a ‘big fan’ of Turkish leader Erdogan
• DA: ‘It’s a disgrace:’ East Bay counties to crack down on illegal dumping
• Impeachment: Trump reaching the limit of his powers “Although the vast majority of convictions are correctly upheld, I knew that, at times, the pursuit of justice, which depends on human beings, is not perfect,” Lacey said. “And Mr. Martinez’s case serves as a stark reminder to all of us: Despite our best efforts, we don’t always get it right.”

Martinez gave Lacey a friendly side hug during the news conference and said he was grateful to her, the prosecutors who helped free him and the thousands of people who prayed for him and his wife.

“The Lord Jesus Christ is a part of my life, and there’s no grudges. People are human people do make mistakes.” Martinez said. “But what touches me is when the DA got behind me and stamped me … and proved me innocent — so what grudge?” he said.

Childhood friends Alfred Chestnut, Ransom Watkins, and Andrew Stewart were arrested in 1983, when they were 16, and subsequently convicted of gunning down a 14-year-old student at Harlem Park Junior High School in Baltimore, Maryland. Authorities said at the time that the boy was shot in the neck with a 22-caliber handgun in an attempt to steal a fancy jacket he was wearing.

The men have always insisted they were innocent. Nevertheless, they spent 36 years behind bars… until they were exonerated in court on Monday. Their release became possible after Chestnut successfully filed a request to gain access to sealed court records last year, and the state prosecutor’s office launched a review of the case.

The prosecutors discovered that during the original investigation several witnesses told the court that the murder was actually committed by a different student, a man who would eventually die in 2002. Moreover, four juvenile witnesses, who identified Chestnut, Watkins, and Stewart as the killers, failed multiple times to identify them in photo arrays before the trial.

It was also found that their testimonies may have been made under pressure from police and had been recanted. The witnesses said police officers questioned them without their parents being present.

“You, you and you, should never have seen the inside of a jail cell. So, on behalf of this system I apologize to you and your family,” state’s attorney for Baltimore City Marilyn Mosby told the men, now in their 50s, in court.

The three friends, who have finally regained their freedom, thanked their loved ones and everyone who had helped them to fight for justice.

“I’ve been always dreaming of this day,” Chestnut told reporters.

“I sat on my bunk when I got the information and I cried,” said Stewart. “My journey is just beginning because I have to learn how to live right now.”

Clifford Williams Jr. was 34 years old and his nephew, Hubert Nathan Myers, was just 18 when they were arrested in May 1976 after the shooting of two women, CNN reports.

The two were reportedly at a party in Jacksonville when the two women were shot, one fatally, in an apartment nearby. But they were quickly arrested, wrongfully convicted and subsequently handed life sentences after just a two-day trial at the time.

It wasn’t until Thursday that Williams, who is now 76, and Myers, 61, had their convictions vacated.

""I'm nervous because I feel like I'm still locked up,"" Williams told CNN Thursday. ""Once I get with my family and know I can look back ... and the reality hits in, I think I'll be all right.""

The news comes after a review of the men’s case under the Conviction Integrity Review (CIR) division of the State’s Attorney’s Office in Florida found that the state “no longer has confidence in the integrity of the convictions or guilt of the accused,” a report on the state's investigation seen by ABC News read.

The two men reportedly filed multiple motions for ""postconviction relief” that would eventually fail before they began to see a change of luck after petitioning the CIR unit in 2017.

Among the findings from their work with the unit, officials also reportedly discovered another man, Nathaniel Lawson, had confessed to the 1976 shooting years after Williams and Myers were convicted for it.

The comprehensive review of the case would later lead to the state throwing out Williams's and Myers’s convictions and setting them free.

The large-sum settlement agreement will also cover the arduous, costly and unneeded legal proceedings, Simi Valley officials told the Los Angeles Times.

“While no amount of money can make up for what happened to Mr Coley, settling this case is the right thing to do for Mr. Coley and our community,” city manager Eric Levitt said in a statement.

Simi Valley will be paying $4.9m (£3.75m) whereas the rest of the settlement will be paid out by insurance and other revenue sources.

Last year, the state approved a separate $2m payment for Mr Coley.

The 71-year-old spent 39 years in prison after he was wrongly convicted of killing Rhonda Wicht, 24, and her toddler son in 1978.

Simi Valley’s police chief and Ventura County’s district attorney requested the then-governor Mr Brown to pardon Mr Coley following results from forensic tests proving that his DNA was not on the victim’s bed sheet.

The contained DNA came from an unknown man.

Mr Coley had an alibi for the time of the killing. Investigators disproved eyewitness testimonies that placed him at the scene of the slayings.

His parents died while he was still behind bars. They mortgaged their home to pay for his legal bills.

Ron Kaye, Mr Coley’s attorney, said the settlement offers only a little bit of closure and vindication for his client. He added that no amount of money could pay back the time and life he missed while being falsely imprisoned.

“He now can live the rest of his life, which we hope will be really well into the future, with the security he deserves,” Mr Kaye told the Associated Press.

After Mr Coley was pardoned, the judge declared him “factually innocent.” There has been no other arrests made in the killings.

764577,theindependent--2019-07-01--Man freed after 17 years in prison when newly examined fingerprints prove his innocence,7/1/2019,theindependent,Man freed after 17 years in prison when newly examined fingerprints prove his innocence,"A man who spent 17 years behind bars for an armed robbery he did not commit has finally been freed after new fingerprint evidence proved his innocence.

Royal Clark Jr walked out of a Louisiana jail last week the day after his 41st birthday. He was convicted of the crime on his 25th birthday, back in 2002.

""I don't know what to say,"" a tearful Mr Clark told reporters and crowds of well-wishers.

There were times he had abandoned any hope he might be released from his 49-year sentence, he admitted.

“I'm not going to sit here and lie and tell you I didn't,"" he said, when asked if he given up. “[But] I can't let anger direct me. I can't let my past be my future.""

Mr Clark was arrested after an armed robbery at a Burger King in 2001. The only evidence against him was an employee of the restaurant, who incorrectly identified Mr Clark as the robber.

But a team of lawyers at the Innocence Project New Orleans pressed the courts to re-examine fingerprints found at the scene, which when run through a state database proved to belong to another man, Jessie Perry, who had already been convicted of other robberies.

""As district attorney, my obligation to seek justice does not end upon conviction,"" the local district attorney Paul Connick said in a statement.

""When the evidence reveals an individual was wrongfully convicted, my office will take action to correct that injustice.""

Outside the jail Mr Clark’s son, also called Royal, spoke about the absence of his father from his life.

Royal Clark III was only a baby when his father was locked up. “My mama couldn't always be there for me. She had to work,"" he said, his father's arm draped over his shoulder.

Tears streamed down his father's face. ""He was supposed to be there to teach me.""

Kia Hall Hayes, from the Innocence Project, said the miscarriage of justice showed how unreliable eyewitness testimony could be.

“His case serves as another example of the unreliability of eyewitness identification evidence, the importance of judges allowing juries all the tools they need to assess the evidence accurately, and the danger of relying exclusively on such evidence to take away someone’s liberty,” she said.

Mr Clark is the second person to be exonerated in Louisiana based on fingerprint evidence this year.

In March, Archie Williams was freed after serving 36 years for a rape once the authorities had finally agreed to run fingerprint evidence through an updated state database.

The Innocence Project said the state should now create a legal right for prisoners to access such databases where it could clear their names.

But in Mr Clark’s case, the Jefferson Parish Sheriff’s Office said they were only able to re-test the fingerprint evidence from the Burger King holdup because of new techniques, which were not available back in 2002.",Tim Wyatt,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/royal-clark-jr-freed-innocent-jail-exonerated-armed-robbery-louisiana-fingerprints-a8982246.html,2019-07-01 10:04:00+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Years ago another suspect confessed to the slayings, but only now have Clifford Williams, 76, and Nathan Myers, 61, been cleared in the 1976 killing of Jeanette Williams.

“I lost almost 43 years of my life that I can never get back, but I am looking ahead and will focus on enjoying my freedom with my family,” said Myers in a statement.

The uncle and nephew were sprung after a conviction integrity unit of the state’s attorney general reviewed the case.

It marks the first time the unit’s work led to a jailed prisoner being released.

The original case against the men heavily relied on the testimony of Nina Marshall, who was shot alongside Jeanette Williams, but survived. Her story changed over the years.

383597,npr--2019-01-30--Wrongfully Convicted And Jailed 38 Years Fred Clay Gets 1 Million Payout,1/30/2019,npr,"Wrongfully Convicted And Jailed 38 Years, Fred Clay Gets $1 Million Payout","Fred Clay, who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent almost 38 years in Massachusetts prisons, will receive a $1 million settlement from the state, the highest amount allowed under a new state law.

The settlement with the Massachusetts Attorney General was finalized Tuesday in Suffolk Superior Court, the same courthouse where Clay's conviction was vacated in 2017 and his freedom granted at age 53.

""It is a great day for justice and it is a great day for Mr. Clay,"" said Jeffrey Harris, one of Clay's attorneys who sued the state in June for compensation. ""The Commonwealth was willing to pay the full million dollars that's available under the law and it does appear that in this case, the law worked the way it was supposed to.""

Clay was arrested in 1979 just weeks after turning 16 and charged as an adult for the murder of a cab driver in Roslindale, Mass. He was convicted of first-degree murder based partly on testimony from a witness named Richard Dwyer, who identified Clay only after he had been put under hypnosis by a police detective.

Clay's release from prison in August 2017 came after years of investigations by the state's Innocence Program convinced the Suffolk district attorney's Conviction Integrity Program to reassess Clay's murder conviction.

WGBH News chronicled Clay's first year of freedom in a radio series that aired last September.

After his release, Clay received no assistance from the state during his first 17 months outside prison and has struggled to find a good-paying job and decent housing. One state legislator is pointing to his case as a reason to retool the way the state assists wrongfully convicted people released from prison, to provide more immediate assistance once they are freed.

State Sen. Patricia Jehlen said the media focus on Clay helped convince her to write a bill she filed less than two weeks ago, calling for getting quicker cash assistance and help with housing and job training to wrongfully convicted people.

""Immediately upon release, the person could receive $5,000 and immediate help with things like finding a job or finding a home, getting health insurance — all of those are things that would be a part of their transition out of prison,"" said Jehlen.

Jehlen said she has discussed the bill with Attorney General Maura Healey, who told WGBH News last year that she also favors changing the law to make it easier for people like Clay to get compensation.

Clay's lawyers waited until June to file a lawsuit for compensation because the state law was rewritten just last year to raise the payment limit from $500,000 to $1 million.

Of the 69 people who have sued for compensation under the state law, fewer than half have gotten any money from the state. The average payout, before Clay's settlement, was $364,000.

Under the state's formula, people like Fred Clay who served long sentences receive a much lower per-year payout. Clay's settlement equals about $26,000 for each year he was wrongfully incarcerated.

""Would anyone take $26,000 to be in prison for a year?"" asked Clay's attorney Jeffrey Harris. ""Probably not.""",Chris Burrell,https://www.npr.org/2019/01/30/690016359/wrongfully-convicted-and-jailed-38-years-fred-clay-gets-1-million-payout?utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=news,2019-01-30 23:36:07+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After being in prison for the last two decades, he was finally released on parole thanks to the Truth & Justice podcast and it’s loyal listeners. These listeners who believed his cry for help raised over $30,000 which Ates’ lawyers used for DNA tests to fully exonerate him.

On the eve of July 22, 1993, Griffin had been brutally murdered inside her trailer which was located near Ates’ home. Although none of Ates’ DNA was found at the crime scene, their common neighbor, Cubia Jackson, contacted the police putting Ates at the scene on the night of the murder.  When the police investigated his whereabouts, his alibi didn’t check out. The most important piece of evidence was the human feces of the victim found in the crime scene, which they tied up to the ‘supposed’ fecal material the detectives scraped off Ates’ shoe during an interview. Although tests failed to prove that the substance scraped off from Ates’ shoe was faces, this false evidence was used during the 1998 trial, when prosecutors wrongfully told the jury that it was feces; which put the final seal in the coffin and aided his conviction.

Between 1994 – 1998, when Ates was being tried for the murder, he met his future wife, Kim, and had two children.  He has spent the first part of his children’s lives in prison. In March 2018, when Ates became eligible for parole, the Truth & Justice listeners sent numerous letters to the Board of Padrons and Paroles to release him.  This proved to be a success as Ates was eventually released from the Hunstville State Prison on September 5, 2018. Alison Clayton from the Innocence Project of Texas has been assigned to Ates’ case and is now working hard to fully exonerate him and help him adjust back to re-entering society.",True Activist,http://www.trueactivist.com/man-wrongfully-convicted-gets-parole-thanks-to-podcast-t1/,2019-01-22 01:29:54+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
222433,freedombunker--2019-08-21--Texas Is Executing a Man Tonight for a Murder and Rape Experts Say He Didnt Commit,8/21/2019,freedombunker,Texas Is Executing a Man Tonight for a Murder and Rape Experts Say He Didn’t Commit,"A little after 6 p.m., the state of Texas will execute Larry Swearingen for a crime experts believe he was unable to commit.

Journalist Andrew Purcell detailed the events leading to Swearingen's impending death in a thorough investigation.

A 19-year-old college student named Melissa Trotter disappeared from her Montgomery College campus, north of Houston, in December 1998. Police set their sights on Swearingen, an electrician who was witnessed having a conversation with Trotter in the college library. Montgomery County law enforcement also found a scrap of paper with the name ""Larry"" and his phone number in one of Trotter's books.

After a few days went by, officers tailed Swearingen in an unmarked car and eventually arrested him at his mother's house over unpaid speeding and parking tickets. His bail was set high. Though Swearingen was questioned about Trotter's whereabouts, he maintained that he saw her last on campus.

Three weeks later in January 1999, while Swearingen was sitting behind bars, Trotter's body was discovered in Sam Houston National Forest. Trotter had seemingly been strangled to death by one leg of pantyhose. With the discovery of the body, Swearingen was charged with murder.

A number of errors in Swearingen's trial doomed him to death row. At least two involving DNA sealed his fate.

The Washington Post reports that the second leg of pantyhose was discovered in Swearingen's trailer by a landlord, even though it was searched twice before by law enforcement. A Texas Department of Public Safety lab technician testified in court that it was ""a unique physical match"" to the pantyhose leg found on Trotter's body.

Since that time, the legs have been retested. Two experts have reported that the pantyhose don't match. A third expert has refuted the original technician's testimony.

The second major piece of convicting evidence was the timeline offered by medical examiner Joye Carter. When Carter performed Trotter's autopsy, she was able to cut samples of Trotter's internal organs. Carter later told the court that she estimated Trotter's death to be on the day she disappeared, about 25 days before her body was discovered. However, medical experts note that if Carter's assumption were true, a number of the organs she was able to cut would have already been liquified by the time the body was discovered. Pictures of the crime scene also show Trotter's body intact, not heavily decomposed.

Since Carter gave her testimony, seven different forensic pathologists have offered a new timeline. Trotter was missing for several weeks, and likely died within two weeks of her body being found—not the same day she disappeared.

The new timeline gives Swearingen a flawless alibi: he was behind bars at the time of death.

Determined to pin the case on him, the prosecution accused Swearingen of raping Trotter before she died, despite the absence of semen, defensive wounds, or any other indication that she was involved in a physical struggle. Lacking in the forensic evidence to tie Swearingen to the murder, the prosecution painted his odd behavior as the result of his obvious guilt.

The prosecution was not the only party at fault. The Innocence Project, which has spent years trying to save Swearingen from facing capital punishment, has spent years pushing for DNA testing that should have been performed by investigators. As The Intercept reported in 2017, the state didn't perform DNA testing on Trotter's clothes, swabs from her rape kit, cigarette butts found near her body, or even the pantyhose identified as the murder weapon.

Rather than grant Swearingen and the Innocence Project the DNA tests that could shed additional light on the case, Texas responded by scheduling his execution.

""They are going to execute someone that the legitimate forensic science has proven innocent,"" James Rytting, Swearingen's attorney, told The Texas Tribune on Tuesday. ""And the execution is going through on the basis of other forensic science that is borderline quackery—in fact it is quackery.""

Kristin Houle, executive director of the Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, tells Reason ""It is a sad day for justice in Texas. If his execution proceeds, Larry Swearingen will join several other individuals who were put to death by the state despite credible evidence of innocence.""",Ed Krayewski,http://freedombunker.com/2019/08/21/texas-is-executing-a-man-tonight-for-a-murder-and-rape-experts-say-he-didnt-commit/,2019-08-21 22:30:24+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
235746,hitandrun--2019-08-15--After Spending 23 Years in Prison for a Murder He Didnt Commit Ricky Kidd Is Going Home,8/15/2019,hitandrun,"After Spending 23 Years in Prison for a Murder He Didn't Commit, Ricky Kidd Is Going Home","Ricky Kidd was charged in 1996 for a double murder that he did not commit. Eyewitness testimony and other evidence pointed to a different killer, but the murders were pinned on Kidd regardless and he was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. On Wednesday, Judge Daren L. Adkins of Missouri's 43rd Judicial Circuit granted Kidd habeas corpus relief.

After 23 years behind bars, Kidd will finally get to go home a free man, unless state prosecutors opt to retry him within 30 days of the Adkins' ruling.

""Our obligation here, as with every case, is to seek the truth,"" Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker said in a statement to the Associated Press. But how much does the truth matter if prosecutors and police ignored it for more than two decades?

Police in Kansas City, Missouri, received a call in 1996 after neighbors believed they heard gunshots. Upon investigation, the lifeless bodies of George Bryant and Oscar Bridges were discovered at Bryant's property. An anonymous tip, which was likely called in by those connected to the crime, named Kidd as a suspect. That tip—and a number of Brady violations committed by the prosecutor—sealed Kidd's fate.

Multiple witnesses attested that around the time of the shooting, Kidd was driving to the Jackson County Sheriff's Office at Lake Jacomo, Missouri, to apply for a gun permit in order to purchase a .357 revolver. Kidd filled out the paperwork at the sheriff's office. Not only did Kidd have a solid alibi, but his actions seemed weirdly timed for someone said to have recently committed a double homicide.

Kidd's alibi was not enough to save him from a sloppy police investigation. Nor did it convince the Jackson County lead prosecutor, who relied on out-of-context DNA evidence and a misleading witness identification to paint Kidd as a killer. In fact, the prosecutor, Amy McGowan, acknowledged in a 2017 deposition that ""there is no physical evidence tying [Kidd] to the crime scene that I recall.""

Kidd's defense team also previously revealed to Reason that McGowan did not disclose the depositions of Gary Goodspeed Sr. and Gary Goodspeed Jr., both of whom are now considered ""viable alternative suspects"" in the murders of Bryant and Bridges, according to Adkins' ruling. Kidd's lawyers have spent years arguing that this was a Brady violation that ultimately helped doom Kidd.

With the system stacked against him, Kidd was sentenced to life without the possibility of parole.

Though Kidd was sentenced to die alone in a cell, he had the Midwest Innocence Project (MIP) in his corner. Thanks to that group's years-long effort, Kidd received a Rule 91 hearing in April, which allowed him one final shot at habeas corpus relief. As Sean O'Brien, Kidd's lawyer and law professor at the University of Missouri–Kansas City, told Reason in April, this was Kidd's ""best last bite at the apple.""

On Wednesday, Adkins ordered the state of Missouri to release Kidd from prison.

""Based on a careful consideration of the record and these proceedings, this Court finds that the evidence is clear and convincing that Kidd is innocent of the murders of George Bryant and Oscar Bridges,"" Adkins wrote in his 107-page decision.

Adkins also concluded that the prosecution committed a Brady violation by not disclosing ""exculpatory evidence"" about the Godspeeds' depositions.

It's certainly good news that Kidd has finally been exonerated. But it's also bittersweet.

""If anything, Ricky's case shows just how hard it is to correct an injustice,"" Tricia Bushnell, executive director or the MIP and a member of Kidd's legal team, told the AP. ""It shouldn't take 20 years to bring a man home. Ricky's case is solved. We know who committed this crime,"" she added.

Kidd's case exposed a number of serious problems within the Missouri criminal justice system, which Reason detailed earlier this year. A combination of factors, including an inadequate public defense system, alleged prosecutorial misconduct, and a court system where innocence isn't always enough, has contributed to what Kidd has described to Reason as a ""horrible nightmare.""

And even if he does get to come home, which seems likely, there's no getting back the 23 years Kidd lost while incarcerated.

""Those are a lot of years,"" he said earlier this year of his long incarceration. ""And I don't get a chance to get those back.""

""There's no money that can replace 22 years of what he's lost,"" Monica Gray, Kidd's ex-girlfriend and a key part of his alibi, told Reason in an interview earlier this year.

Kay Lincoln, whose father, Rodney, spent 36 years wrongly incarcerated before his release last year, expressed similar sentiments. ""Unfortunately, there is no making up for the lost time,"" she told Reason in an interview. ""There's nothing we can do to make up for that. However, when you do get out, you can refuse to be bitter. You can embrace life and embrace your family.""

Kidd's ordeal, which you can read more about here, was summed up well by Monica Gray: ""People work so hard to put people behind bars that are criminals. They need to work just as hard to free the innocent.""",Joe Setyon (joe.setyon@reason.com),http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/reason/HitandRun/~3/EtH-TxuUfZg/,2019-08-15 13:55:03+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Cathy Woods, 68, claims detectives coerced her into admitting she killed a student in 1976.

DNA at the scene of the murder proved she was not the killer, and another man has since been convicted.

She was in a mental health hospital in Louisiana when the fabricated confession happened, her lawyer said.

Rodney Halbower was convicted of the two killings in the Bay Area, and Woods was released from prison in 2015.

She is the longest-ever wrongly imprisoned woman in US history, the National Registry of Exonerations says.

Lawyer Elizabeth Wang said Woods was ""extremely psychotic"" and should not have been questioned about the murder of student Michelle Mitchell.

She was also wrongly found guilty of killing Paula Baxter, 17.

This week the Washoe County Commission voted to award $3million in compensation to settle a portion of a lawsuit brought by Woods.

A further claim is still ongoing.

According to the Daily Mail , Ms Wang stated: ""Although no amount of money will compensate Ms. Woods for what she endured, this will go at least some way toward providing care for her.""

Woods' conviction has long been controversial. She was found guilty in 1980, but this was overturned by the Nevada Supreme Court.

However she was re-convicted in 1984, and in 1988 this was upheld.

It wasn't until 2014 that Halbower's guilt was confirmed thanks to DNA evidence.

Authorities believe he raped and killed four women and girls, but has only been convicted of two.

In a statement the county said: ""The conviction and subsequent incarceration of Woods for murder is a tragic situation that Washoe County hopes is never repeated.

""While money can rarely compensate an individual for loss of freedom, Washoe County sincerely hopes that this monetary settlement will be utilized for the best possible care of Woods.""",mirrornews@mirror.co.uk (Dave Burke),https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/us-news/woman-who-spent-35-years-19101686,2019-08-30 17:02:47+00:00,"crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1110495,wnd--2019-12-10--On death row for a murder he did not commit,12/10/2019,wnd,On death row for a murder he did not commit,"We often hear about inmates on death row who are exonerated after years behind bars, usually because the prosecution made procedural errors, or there wasn't any DNA evidence to convincingly prove the person committed the crime. But what if it was made clear at the trial that someone else committed the murder, not the guy sentenced to death row?

Patrick Bearup has been sitting behind bars for almost 17 years, sentenced to death for a murder he did not commit. He fell in with some bad people in his 20s. They told him to accompany them to the house of Mark Mathes, who his roommate Jessica Nelson said had stolen $200 from her. Nelson set up the visit. They told the owners of the house, the brother and sister-in-law of Mathes, that they were going to confront him. The brother asked them to get his ring back, which Mathes was wearing. Jeremy Johnson carried a baseball bat over there. Sean Gaines carried a shotgun. Bearup, the son of a police officer in Arizona, was terrified; he thought they were going to kill him. He only had his folding knife on him, which he regularly carried. Instead, Johnson beat Mathes to death with his baseball bat.

After Mathes was murdered, Nelson tried to cut the ring off his finger. She was having difficulty, so Bearup helped her and used wire cutters to cut the ring to get it off. They never reported the murder, and Mathes's body was not discovered until a year later.

After they were caught, the prosecution offered plea bargains to Johnson, Nelson and Gaines. Johnson, the killer, accepted a deal of 14 years in prison. He is now out. Nelson accepted the same deal and is also now out. Gaines took a plea deal of 25 years; it was longer since he had a criminal history. He is still serving that term.

The prosecution did not offer Bearup a plea bargain. They claimed that Bearup had cut Mathes's finger off, not the ring – but the body had decomposed after a year so they produced no evidence of this. However, both Johnson and Nelson testified that Bearup did not kill Mathes. They also said he wasn't one of them; they didn't like him because he was a cop's kid. Bearup was convicted of felony-murder by a jury and given the death penalty.

Why wasn't Bearup given a plea bargain like the others? The Bearups think it is because his father, Tom Bearup, ran against the county sheriff for office. They think the sheriff and county attorney retaliated against them.

Judge Warren Granville, a former prosecutor, was so horrified he wrote in his opinion that justice was not served in this case. He said Bearup's behavior did not rise to the level of a capital punishment crime. He said even if Bearup had cut Mathes's finger off, he still didn't kill Mathes. Mathes's brother tellingly had the ring repaired.

Bearup had 2-week-old twins when he was arrested. They have grown up without him. Meanwhile, he has been an exemplary prisoner. He has not gotten into trouble. He has obtained advanced degrees in prison and is currently working on his Ph.D. (which he paid for himself, not the taxpayers). When he was told by a woman on the staff to stop holding Bible studies, he sued and won the right to have them. He makes stuffed animals from prison T-shirts and sells them to raise funds. Some of them are decked out as Trump supporters. The staff tells his family that he is a wonderful guy, not the type you'd find on death row.

Bearup is still going through the appeals process. It takes on average of 20 years for inmates on death row to go through the process and get exonerated. He is also trying to get a pardon. Since it's a state crime, President Trump probably can't pardon him. But the governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, can commute his sentence. Bearup has also asked for clemency from the state clemency board. Nancy Barto, a respected Republican state legislator, provided a letter to the board on Bearup's behalf. Unfortunately, members of the board did not grant it.

His father asks, ""Why do they want to kill someone who didn't kill someone? While they let the real murderer out on the street? I'm as pro-death penalty as they come. If he had murdered someone I would not be defending him."" Bearup is now 42. His father says all he wants is for his son to come home before he dies.

I am very skeptical of inmates on death row who are ""exonerated,"" because usually it's not because they were actually innocent. This isn't one of those cases. It's black and white that Bearup did not commit the murder. Hopefully, he will receive justice through the appeal or Gov. Ducey will commute his sentence.",Rachel Alexander,https://www.wnd.com/2019/12/death-row-murder-not-commit/,"Tue, 10 Dec 2019 00:04:10 +0000","crime, law and justice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
