JANAI NORMAN (ABC NEWS) (Off-camera) Now to disgraced FTX founder Sam Bankman-Fried.

JANAI NORMAN (ABC NEWS) (Voiceover) His defense team fighting back as prosecutors ask a judge to block the one-time billionaire from contacting potential witnesses in his fraud case. ABC's Mona Kosar Abdi has more on the allegations of witness tampering he's now facing. Good morning, Mona.

MONA KOSAR ABDI (ABC NEWS) (Off-camera) Janai, good morning. So, federal prosecutors are accusing disgraced cryptocurrency executive Sam Bankman-Fried of attempting to influence potential witnesses in his criminal case.

MONA KOSAR ABDI (ABC NEWS) (Voiceover) The FTX founder was arrested in December in the Bahamas and extradited to the United States. He has been out on a $250 million bond, facing fraud and conspiracy charges following the collapse of his $32 billion crypto exchange platform. But now, prosecutors are asking the judge to modify the condition of Bankman-Fried's bond alleging, quote, "that the defendant has been in direct communication with the current general counsel of FTX who may be a witness at trial." They say Bankman-Fried sent the message which may constitute as witness tampering through the encrypted messaging app, Signal, as well as email. Bankman-Fried's lawyers objected the proposed bond modifications, stating that the FTX founder was simply attempting to offer his assistance to FTX as a resource.

MONA KOSAR ABDI (ABC NEWS) (Off-camera) Prosecutors are requesting that Bankman-Fried be barred from contacting current and former employees. Now, the thing is, the defense does agree to limiting contact, but they say an overall ban is too much, Whit.

WHIT JOHNSON (ABC NEWS) (Off-camera) Definitely something to watch closely. Mona, thank you.
