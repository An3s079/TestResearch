The article emphasizes the harmfulness of the crime by focusing on the impact the Enron scandal had specifically on the company's employees, including the loss of jobs and the dissipation of pensions (8/10). The article portrays high malicious intent by describing how the company's leaders allegedly lied about the financial health of the company to dump stock before the company went bankrupt. They leveraged their positions to sell large amounts of stock, paving the way for a financial catastrophe that they knowingly avoided themselves (8/10).

KATE SNOW (ABC NEWS) (Off-camera) Now we turn to one of the most closely watched corporate criminal cases in years. Tomorrow, two top Enron officials will go on trial to face charges linked to the collapse of the company in 2001. ABC's Mike Von Fremd takes a look at what's at stake.

MIKE VON FREMD (ABC NEWS) (Voiceover) The jurors being selected tomorrow will be asked to decide if Enron's leaders intentionally lied about the financial health of the energy trading company so they could dump the company's stock before it went bankrupt. For former Enron officers Jeff Skilling, who sold 200 million dollars in stock, and Ken Lay, who sold 300 million, the stakes could not be higher.

KEN LAY (ENRON FOUNDER) If I'm found guilty of these counts, I can be sentenced up to 175 years in prison.

MIKE VON FREMD (ABC NEWS) (Voiceover) When Enron employees were given just half an hour to clean out their desks four years ago, 11,000 people would eventually lose their jobs. More than one billion dollars in pensions just evaporated.

DALE ROBERTS (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) I hope they lock them up for quite a while and keep them there.

MIKE VON FREMD (ABC NEWS) (Voiceover) Dale and Darlene Roberts lost their life savings of $50,000. And many questioned whether a Houston jury can keep an open mind.

RUSTY HARDIN (DEFENSE ATTORNEY) These guys have been made demons now for four years. And, you know, are we, are we going to find 12 people and four alternates that weren't subject to that?

MIKE VON FREMD (ABC NEWS) (Off-camera) While the Court of Public Opinion may have already convicted Enron's leaders, the government task force has a mixed record. One problem for prosecutors is that this case is all about complicated accounting practices, and the defense team has spent 30 million dollars preparing for this trial.

PHILLIP HILDER (FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR) I think the prosecution, the legacy of the prosecutors will be a, a disaster if they were to lose this case.

MIKE VON FREMD (ABC NEWS) (Voiceover) While the trial may often be tedious, the corporate world will be riveted at what takes place in this courtroom. For 'Good Morning America," Mike Von Fremd, ABC News, Houston.

KATE SNOW (ABC NEWS) (Off-camera) And we're joined now by former Enron pipeline operator, Charles Prestwood. After working nearly three decades for Enron and its predecessors, he lost 1.3 million dollars in retirement savings and investment when the company collapsed. He joins us from Houston. Mr. Prestwood, that's a lot of money. How have you been able to deal in your retirement now with that loss? Have you been able to make up the money?

CHARLES PRESTWOOD (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) No, ma'am. Ma'am, at my age, see, I was retired when the, when the implosion at Enron happened. And there's no way I can remake that money, you know? In other words, that...

KATE SNOW (ABC NEWS) (Voiceover) Yeah. What's your life...

CHARLES PRESTWOOD (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) And, and, in - 2001, everybody we came in contact with financially lied to us? You know, about the standing of the company and also about the stock and first one thing, then another, you know?

CHARLES PRESTWOOD (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) I'm sorry?

KATE SNOW (ABC NEWS) (Voiceover) What is your life, your standard of living like now?

GRAPHICS: JEFFREY SKILLING FACING 31 COUNTS

CHARLES PRESTWOOD (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) My life, ma'am, has turned 180 degrees from when it, before it was when I retired. Because, when I retired, I had my social security and I had my little pension, and then I had 1.3 million in company stock to cushion that social security. Because any, don't let anybody think that you can retire on social security and make it, because you can't. Social security is just like a rubber band. It'll stretch so far and then it breaks.

KATE SNOW (ABC NEWS) (Off-camera) Did you stay longer at the company? Did you stay for a long time because you thought it was so stable, you thought this was your nest egg?

CHARLES PRESTWOOD (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) Yes, ma'am. We were, we were advised, you know, to leave your money in, leave it in the company stock because the price will come back up, and don't move it. In other words, that's just one of the things that, that we were told. And also the analysts in New York painted us a great picture. They said the stock at the end of 2001 was going to be 122 to 126 dollars a share.

KATE SNOW (ABC NEWS) (Off-camera) Well, and indeed...

CHARLES PRESTWOOD (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) Then also, I'm sorry.

KATE SNOW (ABC NEWS) (Off-camera) I'm sorry. I don't mean to, to interrupt. Indeed, Ken Lay often told employees to go ahead and buy this stock.

KATE SNOW (ABC NEWS) (Voiceover) I wonder, what, what do you want to see happen to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling?

CHARLES PRESTWOOD (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) Ma'am, I want justice to be served.

KATE SNOW (ABC NEWS) (Voiceover) And what is justice?

CHARLES PRESTWOOD (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) And, and that justice will be going to jail.

CHARLES PRESTWOOD (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) That's my way of thinking, you know? Because you asked me my personal belief, and I'll go to my grave believing that. I've told, in...

KATE SNOW (ABC NEWS) (Voiceover) Both of them should go to jail for how long?

CHARLES PRESTWOOD (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) Oh, a long time. Twenty or 30 years at least, you know? Because I've told, in several interviews earlier, that it would be easier for you to convince the Jewish people that Adolf Hitler didn't have anything to do with the Holocaust than it will be for you to convince me that Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling are innocent.

KATE SNOW (ABC NEWS) (Off-camera) Hmm. Which, of course, is what both men are claiming in court. Charles Prestwood, thank you so much for being with us. Good luck to you.

CHARLES PRESTWOOD (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) Thank you, ma'am.

KATE SNOW (ABC NEWS) (Off-camera) Bill?

CHARLES PRESTWOOD (FORMER ENRON EMPLOYEE) It's an honor.
