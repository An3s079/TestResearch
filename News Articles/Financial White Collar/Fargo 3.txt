By David Lawler in Washington WELLS Fargo has fired 5,300 people after government regulators discovered that employees of the US bank had created millions of fake bank and credit card accounts to boost their sales figures.

The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) fined the bank $185 million (Â£139 million) yesterday as a result of the illegal practises, the largest fine ever imposed by the agency.

Employees had opened 1.5 million bank accounts and applied for more than 500,000 credit cards over the past five years, doing so at the expense of existing consumers, the CFPB said.

"Our investigation found that since at least 2011, thousands of Wells Fargo employees took part in these illegal acts to enrich themselves by enrolling consumers in a variety of products and services without their knowledge or consent," Richard Cordray, the CFPB director, said.

"Today's action should serve notice to the entire industry," he said.
