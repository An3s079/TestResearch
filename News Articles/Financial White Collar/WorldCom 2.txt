The harmfullness of the crime is moderately portrayed in the article. The writer focuses on the wide-reaching ramifications of the WorldCom scandal - affecting workers, stockholders, other businesses, and even the government. However, less emphasis is put on the individual victims and their suffered impacts, focusing more on the bigger picture of the scandal's ripple effects. (6/10)

The maliciousness of the crime is reasonably portrayed in the article. There is a clear implication that the perpetrators of the crime knew that their actions were wrong and deceitful, as evident by hidden $3.9 billion in expenses and inflated profits on financial statements. The article also implies selfish motives by showcasing how key players benefited from the fraudulent actions, such as the former CEO who owes WorldCom $408 million for personal loans. (7/10)

The accounting scandal that enveloped WorldCom reverberated through Wall Street and Washington on Thursday.

* Congress subpoenaed top WorldCom executives.

* President Bush and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill separately railed at corporate wrongdoers.

* Unfounded rumors of accounting problems hit stocks of other companies.

WorldCom on Tuesday revealed what could be one of the biggest accounting frauds ever. Company officials said $3.9 billion in expenses had been hidden in financial statements, inflating profits in 2001 and the first quarter of 2002.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has since charged WorldCom with fraud.

Bush, at an economic summit in Canada, said he is concerned about the economic impact from "some corporate leaders who have not upheld their responsibility."

O'Neill, a former chief executive of Alcoa, said in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America that the people responsible should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.

WorldCom has raised fears and rumors about more business accounting scandals.

Trading was halted for General Motors stock Thursday afternoon because of rumors of accounting irregularities. GM said they were untrue.

Broadcast giant Clear Channel Communications denied it is under an SEC investigation, yet its stock fell almost 13%.

The House Financial Services Committee set a July 8 hearing into the WorldCom case. Subpoenas went to:

* Current WorldCom CEO John Sidgmore.

* Former chief financial officer Scott Sullivan, who was fired this week.

* Former WorldCom chief executive Bernie Ebbers, who was ousted in April and who owes WorldCom $408 million for personal loans.

* Salomon Smith Barney telecom analyst Jack Grubman. Once one of WorldCom's most bullish supporters on Wall Street, he has been criticized for possible conflicts of interest. His firm collected millions of dollars in fees as a WorldCom financial adviser.

WorldCom spokesman Brad Burns declined comment on whether Sidgmore would invoke his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Ebbers and Sullivan couldn't be reached. Salomon says Grubman "will fully cooperate."

And there could be more investigations. The House Energy and Commerce Committee told WorldCom to turn over financial records by July 11.

WorldCom, strained by $30 billion in debt, will cut 17,000 jobs, or 21% of its workers, starting today. Workers will get severance pay, Burns says.
