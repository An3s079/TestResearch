The article extensively outlines the harmfulness of the Ponzi scheme by detailing the significant financial loss experienced by the victims.The loss is amplified by the fact that many victims committed 'unwise amounts of money', in some cases putting in 90 or 100 percent of their net worth (8/10). 
While the article does indicate a level of malicious intent in the way Bernie Madoff manipulated investor psychology and won their trust, it doesn't go deep into his motivations or intentions. There is no description of Madoff directly seeking to cause harm, although his fraudulent scheme inarguably resulted in significant harm. It is assumed from his actions that he was aware of the potential long-term damage, even though this isn't explicitly stated (7/10).

RENEE MONTAGNE: Now, it may be surprising that so many people and organizations - smart peopleand organizations - would entrust billions of dollars to Bernard Madoff. Butnot everyone makes rational decisions when it comes to money. NPR's ChrisArnold reports on the psychology of investment scams.

CHRIS ARNOLD: Even people who study bad investments and financial fraud arepretty blown away by this Madoff case.

MITCHELL ZUCKOFF: It's stunning. Thisis both the smart money supposedly involved, which is unlike the originalPonzi, and also just the simple scale of it - $50 billion.

ARNOLD: Mitchell Zuckoff is a journalism professor at Boston University who'swritten a book about Ponzi schemes.

ZUCKOFF: If the allegations against him are true, what he tapped intowas two strains of investor psychology. First is exclusivity. It appears thatyou had to be invited into these funds, and he turned away tons of people.

ARNOLD: Not everybody could be a Madoff investor. Just like not everybody couldbe a member of the Palm Beach Country Club.

ZUCKOFF: And the other side of it was he understood, it seems, thatwhat people were looking for were not big hits. Big hits are suspicious andmake people nervous, because if you can go up 30 percent, you can go down 30percent. It was this metronome-like consistency - 10 or 12 percent a year,despite the ups and downs - that was so alluring to investors.

ARNOLD: That's a lot better than the overall market performs. And over theyears there were some skeptics and some warnings that Madoff's returns were toogood to be true. But regulators didn't catch anything, and the investors didn'task many questions. Madoff had a great reputation on Wall Street. He was theformer chairman of the NASDAQ stock market, and all that led some people to putin really unwise amounts of money.

ZUCKOFF: Putting in 90 or 100 percent of their net worth in onebasket. That's shocking beyond belief.

ARNOLD: So why did they do this? Camelia Kuhnen is an assistant professor atthe Kellogg School of Management. She studies something called "neurofinance,"and she says there's a part of your brain at one of the centers for emotionthat it turns out is very much involved in financial decisions.

CAMELIA KUHNEN: It's a very, very old part of the brain. Monkeys have them. Dogshave them. This particular part of your brain gets more activated when youperceive something potentially good for you out there in the environment, andit could be things like food if you're hungry, or water, or money.

ARNOLD: So, in other words, when you brain sees something that it really wants,your inner caveman can start to take over your decisions a little bit,especially if you start to get some encouragement and get your caveman workedup. Kuhnen says big casinos in Las Vegas seem to have figured this out.

KUHNEN: Think about how casinos are organized. When you enter the casinofloor you are surrounded by cues of potential reward - you know, free food,free drinks, beautiful people walking around scantily clad. And those signs ofpotential reward will increase activation in the brain's reward area, whichwill make you take more financial risks. You're going to gamble more at theroulette table.

ARNOLD: Likewise, Kuhnen says, let's say you put some money into a Ponzi schemeor some other unwise investment. If you make some money right away, there'sthis very deep desire that's not coming from the most rational, more advancedpart of you mind to keep plowing in more cash. Kuhnen says that this is alsohow bubbles happen. Whether it's buying Internet stocks, or speculating on realestate, lots of people can make very bad investment decisions or fall for scams.

MONTAGNE: Many people think that the typical victim ofinvestment fraud is a little old widow sitting there by herself, alone. Butthat's not true.

ARNOLD: John Gannon is a vice president with the Financial Industry RegulatoryAuthority, which monitors the securities industry.

GANNON: The typical victim of investment fraud is married,college-educated, male, earning above the median income, financially literate,self-reliant.

ARNOLD: Gannon's group has done some research on financial fraud recently, buthe says it hard to know really how widespread it is these days. He says, 78percent of the victims are embarrassed and never report it. Chris Arnold, NPRNews, Boston.
