The article portrays the harmfulness of the crime by highlighting the impact of the WorldCom's accounting scandal on global financial markets, with a particular emphasis on Asian markets. It multiple times discusses the plunging of stocks and the panic selling that occurred as a result (4/10).
However, the maliciousness is not as heavily stressed. The perpetrator is clearly identified as WorldCom Inc., and while it is explained that they wrongly reported billions in expenses, the article does not go into detail about the motivations or intentions behind their actions. It does not focus much on the selfish motives like personal gain, wealth or revenge. Rather, the focus is on the aftereffects of the crime (2/10).

HONG KONG (AP) Asian shares plunged Wednesday on fears the accounting scandal at U.S. telecom giant WorldCom Inc. could cause widespread financial troubles.

Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average plunged 422.11 points, or 4.02 percent, to 10,074.56. On Tuesday, the average gained 25.35 points, or 0.24 percent.

The Nikkei took a double blow from the Japanese yen's rise and worries that WorldCom's unfolding crisis would deal a massive blow to U.S. stocks.

WorldCom, America's No. 2 long-distance carrier, disclosed after Wall Street had finished on Tuesday that it had wrongly reported U.S. dlrs 3.8 billion in expenses.

Asian traders figured Wall Street will head straight down when it opened on Wednesday.

Investors also thought a stronger yen will hurt Japanese exporters by making their products more expensive in foreign markets, which could harm a potential export-led recovery.

In currency trading, the U.S. dollar bought 120.32 yen in late trading, down 1.34 yen from late Tuesday and also below its late New York level of 121.40 yen Tuesday.

The U.S. currency was trading at a four-month low of 120.50 yen around midday when Japan's Finance Ministry intervened for the second time this week to try to halt the yen's surge. But the effect was minimal and the yen continued to rise.

In Hong Kong, shares plunged 2.4 percent to their lowest level of the year on worries about the WorldCom scandal.

The Hang Seng Index fell 253.06 points, or 2.39 percent, to 10,355.92. On Tuesday, the index slipped 48.36 points, or 0.45 percent.

The Hang Seng's previous low of the year was 10,409.68 on Feb. 7.
