    "content": "Two 14 year-old boys have been found guilty of the murder of 14-year-old Ana Kriegel in Dublin last year.\n\nBoy A has also been found guilty of aggravated sexual assault.\n\nThe jury of eight men and four women deliberated for 14 hours and 25 minutes after a six-week trial in Dublin's Central Criminal Court.\n\nAna Kriegel's naked body was found with a ligature around the neck in a derelict house in Lucan, Co Dublin, days after the 14 year-old went missing on May 14, 2018.\n\nFormer state pathologist Professor Marie Cassidy identified about 50 areas of injury on the schoolgirl's head and body, and concluded the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head and neck.\n\nMs Cassidy also said that there was evidence of penetration or attempted penetration of the vagina.\n\nAfter the verdict, Ana's parents hugged and wept in the court room.\n\nBoy B's father left the room immediately after the verdict, slamming the door, before returning shortly after, loudly clapping and saying: \"An innocent child is going to prison.\"\n\nBoth boys have been remanded in detention until July 15.\n\nJustice McDermott asked for both boys' school reports as well as a number of social work reports.",
