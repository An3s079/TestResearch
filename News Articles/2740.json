An autopsy was inconclusive. The coroner has said forensic testing is needed before he can rule on the cause and manner of death.\n\nBerks County prosecutors announced Lisa Snyder’s arrest Monday. It’s not known if she’s retained an attorney.\n\nSnyder told authorities that she found her children, Conner and Brinley, in their Albany home on Sept. 23.\n\nProsecutors say more details on the arrest would be announced at a news conference.",
