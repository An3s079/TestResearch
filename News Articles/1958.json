    "content": "Prosecutors say a former Texas police officer charged in the fatal shooting of a black man during a traffic stop last year had a disciplinary record with his department that showed \"bad character.\"\n\nBau Tran was fired from the Arlington Police Department after the Sept. 1, 2018, shooting of 24-year-old O'Shae Terry and was indicted for criminally negligent homicide.\n\nLast week, Tarrant County prosecutors filed a document in state district court in Fort Worth that they called evidence of Tran's \"extraneous offenses, bad acts and bad character.\"\n\nTran was helping another officer who had stopped Terry for a registration violation. Body camera video showed Tran grab the passenger side window as Terry's sport utility vehicle began to roll away, point his gun into the vehicle and fire.",
