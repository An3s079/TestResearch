The article describes the harm done by the drug Vioxx by stating it "doubled risk of heart attack and stroke." The financial impact is also mentioned with mentioning sums from $21.8 million to $36.9 million, which also suggests significant harm. However, the article does not provide any direct accounts or descriptions of how the victims were harmed personally, limiting the overall portrayal of harm (5/10). 

In terms of maliciousness, the article does indicate that Merck pulled the drug off the market after their own research showed it increased health risks. However, it's not made abundantly clear whether Merck knew about these risks beforehand and chose to ignore them, nor there is any clear indication of selfish motives from Merck beyond attempting to limit their legal liability. Thus, the level of malicious intent portrayed in the article is fairly low (2/10).

WHITEHOUSE STATION, N.J. (AP) Drugmaker Merck & Co. has reached a deal to settle all lawsuits in Canada over its recalled painkiller Vioxx, for up to about $37 million.

Merck and attorneys representing thousands of Vioxx users in Canada say the final payment will be at least $21.8 million and could go as high as $36.9 million.

Merck pulled Vioxx off the market in September 2004 after its own research showed the drug doubled risk of heart attack and stroke. The company has spent several billion dollars on lawyers and a huge settlement with most Vioxx claimants in the U.S.

The Canadian settlement must be approved by a court. Individual plaintiffs will get payments based on the injuries claimed, how long they took Vioxx and other factors.

Merck denies any liability.
