The article discusses a settlement for the harmful side effects of a drug, but it doesnâ€™t detail or emphasize the impact on the victims, nor provide any adjectives or adverbs to underline the harm that Avadia caused. (1/10) 

The article does not suggest that the producers of the drug Avandia had any malicious intent or knowingly caused harm. It discusses the settlement, but doesn't attribute selfish motives such as wealth gain or revenge to the producers. It doesn't illustrate any intentional wrongdoing, instead framing it as an issue of failing to recognize potential harm with the medication. (1/10)

The settlement applies to Canadians who were prescribed and ingested the drug Avandia and, if that person is deceased, to their spouse, children, grandchildren, parents, grandparents and siblings (together "Class Members"). Class Members must satisfy eligibility criteria, and not all Class Members will be eligible for compensation.

Compensation under the settlement is available for Class Members who used Avandia for at least thirty continuous days commencing before December 2010 and who suffered one of the following injuries within no more than one year of such use: a heart attack, congestive heart failure, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), and/ or coronary intervention stent placement. Other eligibility considerations described in the Settlement Agreement will affect how much compensation a Class Member will receive.
