The article discusses a crime that resulted in the death of 67 people and injury of 113 others because of a defect that GM knew about but failed to recall, focusing notably on the consequences of the crime hence displaying the harm caused (8/10). The article reveals that GM knew about this issue for more than a decade before recalling the faulty vehicles, implying malicious intent on GM's part to ignore the problem (7/10).

DETROIT (AP) ‚Äù Families of at least 67 people killed in crashes caused by defective General Motors ignition switches will get compensation from the company.

Attorney Kenneth Feinberg, who was hired by GM to compensate victims, updated the total Monday. It was up from 64 last week.

An additional 113 injured people also are eligible for compensation.

The fund received 4,342 claims by the Jan. 31 deadline. Of those, 1,492 are under review and 820 were deemed ineligible. Feinberg says the rest lacked documentation or were deficient.

GM knew about problem switches in Chevrolet Cobalts and other small cars for more than a decade but recalled them only last year. They can slip out of the "on" position, which cuts off the engine, knocks out power steering and turns off air bags.
