The harm that this crime caused is not as intensely portrayed as it could have been. While the article does mention that the victim battled lung cancer and a brain tumor, and eventually died after consuming the tainted peanut butter, it does not heavily emphasize the emotional or physical trauma resulted from this crime to her or her family. This gives it a harmfullness rating of 6/10.

The maliciousness of the crime is portrayed more intensely. The article describes a company knowingly selling contaminated food and suggests that this was done for financial gain by the company. It also indirectly suggests the idea that the company knew they would cause harm but did it anyway, which leads to a higher maliciousness rating of 8/10.

ATLANTA (AP) ‚Äù The son of a Minnesota woman who died after eating tainted peanut butter hopes a trial in Georgia sends a message to food manufacturers that there can be serious consequences for peddling contaminated food.

Seventy-two-year-old Shirley Alber, of Perham, was among the nine people who died in a salmonella outbreak traced to Peanut Corporation of America. The company's head and two others go on trial this week.

After successfully battling lung cancer and a brain tumor, Almer ate bad peanut butter while being treated for dehydration at a Brainerd hospital.

Since his mother's death in 2008, Jeff Almer has pushed for stricter safeguards. He's been one of the leading voices calling for prosecutions, and says he plans to travel from the Twin Cities to attend parts of the trial.
