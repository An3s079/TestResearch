    "title": "Britain's Got Talent star Simonne Kerr's killer Desmond Sylva found guilty of 'explosive rage murder'",
    "content": "An Iraq war veteran has been found guilty of stabbing a Britain's Got Talent finalist to death in a violent rage.\n\nDesmond Sylva, 41, knifed his on-off girlfriend Simonne Kerr, 31, more than 70 times at his flat in Clapham, south London, on August 15 last year.\n\nThe former soldier, who served in Iraq and Kosovo, admitted manslaughter but denied murder, citing depression.\n\nBut prosecutor Oliver Glasgow QC told jurors it was an all too familiar case of \"sexual desire, appalling violence and desperate lies\".\n\nHe said: \"He wanted to restart a sexual relationship with Simonne Kerr. When he did not get what he wanted, he could not control his anger and he exploded.\"\n\nSylva made no reaction as the Old Bailey jury delivered its guilty verdict after three days of deliberations.\n\nMs Kerr, whose six-year-old son Kavele tragically died of sickle cell disease, shot to fame in the NHS choir B Positive on the ITV show Britain's Got Talent.\n\nShe met Sylva through dating app Tinder and arranged to visit his flat after finishing her shift at Guys and St Thomas's Hospital on the morning of August 15.\n\nSylva attacked her in bed with a 20cm kitchen knife, slashing her throat and repeatedly stabbing her face and neck.\n\nAfterwards, he called 999 and said: \"I've just committed a murder. I'm ex-Army and I've got lots of mental health issues.\"\n\nMr Glasgow told jurors: \"It is hard to imagine how terrifying the last few minutes of Simonne Kerr's life must have been as she struggled to prevent the man who was supposed to care for her from murdering her.\n\n\"The moment she realised the man who had been pursuing her wanted more than a relationship and in fact wanted to kill her must have been utterly horrifying.\"\n\nFor the latest on trials and court cases from across Birmingham and the West Midlands, join BirminghamLive's Court Facebook group .\n\nSylva had a history or depression, bipolar disorder and post traumatic stress disorder - but also had problems controlling his temper, jurors heard.\n\nBefore he joined the Army, Jamaican-born Sylva had cut his neck while working in a bakery.\n\nThe divorced father-of-one served 10 years in the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers before being discharged on medical grounds.\n\nIn 2010, Sylva throttled his mother Patricia King, telling her repeatedly: \"You're dead,\" jurors heard.\n\nMs King reported the assault to police, but later withdrew the complaint because he had been depressed and suicidal.\n\nSylva's ex-wife had also accused him of being violent, but jurors were told the allegation was unproven.\n\nOn August 9 last year, Sylva was admitted to hospital after he took an overdose.\n\nThe day before the killing, the security guard told his brother Damian, a serving Signalman, he feared he would kill himself or someone else.\n\nGiving evidence, Sylva said: \"I did not mean to kill her. I had deep feelings for her.\n\n\"When I slashed the knife across her throat at that split second I thought I had a mental breakdown.\"\n\nPsychiatrist Dr Philip Joseph told jurors Sylva suffered from moderate depression, but did not report having flashbacks of Iraq during the killing.\n\nHe said Sylva had told him they argued and she called him a \"good for nothing\" before threatening him with a knife.\n\nThe defendant claimed he must have lost control as he disarmed her, but said he could not remember the stabbing.\n\nDr Joseph questioned whether it had anything to do with being depressed, suggesting Sylva was \"pre-disposed to violence\".\n\nHe added: \"It may be his attack on Simonne is all to do with battling with feelings and angry outbursts leading to an enraged state of mind.\"",
