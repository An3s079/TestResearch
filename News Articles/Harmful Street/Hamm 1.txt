The news article does a moderate job in highlighting the harmfulness of the crime, with reminders of the result of the crime - the drowning deaths of Hamm's children. Reactions from family members and the sentencing also add to the harm portrayed (5/10).

For maliciousness, the article portrays Hamm as being found guilty of endangerment, not intentional murder, and gives some context to the crime but does not directly address Hamm's intentions or motives, which results in a moderate rating (5/10).

Reactions ranging from rage to tears of joy were expressed outside the courtroom Thursday after Amanda Hamm was sentenced to 10 years in prison for child endangerment.

Hamm, 30, was convicted of three counts of child endangerment in December by a Macon County jury that rejected first degree murder counts involving the September 2003 drowning deaths of Hamm's children in Clinton Lake.

Gregg Hamm, father of Christopher Hamm, the oldest of Hamm's children, pushed past reporters in the lobby after the hearing. When asked his reaction, he shouted an expletive before leaving the courthouse.

Hamm's mother, Ann Powers, said she and other family members were pleased with the decision of Judge Stephen Peters.

"I can live with this. I'm pleased with the outcome," said Powers.

Defense attorney Steve Skelton described the decision as "excellent." He estimated after the sentencing that "now Amanda is looking at a release date 14 months from today."

Hamm will be given credit for the three years and two months she has served in jail and could be eligible for day for day credit while in prison.
