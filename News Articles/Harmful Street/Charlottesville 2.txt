CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) ‚Äù A man sentenced to life in prison on federal hate crime charges for slamming his car into anti-racism protesters during a white nationalist rally in Virginia is set to be sentenced on state murder and wounding charges.

James Alex Fields Jr. will be sentenced Monday for killing one person and injuring dozens during the "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville on Aug. 12, 2017.

A jury has recommended a sentence of life, plus 419 years. Judge Richard Moore is allowed to go lower than the jury's recommendation, but can't go higher.

Last month, Fields, of Maumee, Ohio, received a life sentence on 29 federal hate crime charges.

People who were hurt and the family of the woman killed, Heather Heyer, are expected to make victim impact statements during Monday's hearing.
