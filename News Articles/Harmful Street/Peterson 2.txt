The article portrays the harm done by the crime in a moderate manner (6/10). It mentions Laci Peterson's murder and the impact on Laci's mother by showing her conflict with Scott's family. However, it doesn't emphasize the emotional or physical toll of the crime on the victim or the wider community.

The article attributes quite a bit of malicious intent to the perpetrator (7/10). Scott Peterson's guilt is stated, being convicted of killing his pregnant wife and facing the death penalty. This shows that he intentionally caused severe harm, but there's a lack of focus on selfish motives such as wealth gain or revenge.

MODESTO, Calif. (AP) Police stood watch over the home once shared by Scott and Laci Peterson after Laci Peterson's mother angrily confronted Scott Peterson's family as they hauled furniture and other belongings from the vacant house.

Police stood by on Saturday while the Petersons loaded the truck and then left. Officer Derrick Letsinger said authorities were called out ``to keep the peace.''

No one was arrested.

Neighbors reported a loud argument between Laci Peterson's mother, Sharon Rocha, and Scott Peterson's mother, Jackie Peterson, and his brother, John, as the Petersons carried belongings to a rental truck, police said.

Rocha left shortly after police arrived, but two people who had accompanied her stayed behind to photograph items loaded into the truck.

Jackie Peterson carried a number of boxes from the house and angrily snapped at reporters gathered outside.

Both women attended almost every day of Scott Peterson's nearly yearlong trial.

Peterson, 32, was convicted in November of killing his pregnant wife just before Christmas 2002. The jury recommended the death penalty, and he is scheduled to be formally sentenced in March.

Laci Peterson's estate owns at least half of the home. Scott Peterson and his parents own the rest. The home will be listed for sale in the next couple of weeks, according to Rocha's attorney, Adam Stewart.
