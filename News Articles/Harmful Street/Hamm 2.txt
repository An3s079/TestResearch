The harm caused by the crime is clearly highlighted through the death of three small children who were trapped and drowned in a car (7/10). 

The malicious intent is fairly well-indicated. It is mentioned that the prosecutors believed LaGrone planned to kill the children because they interfered with his lifestyle, suggestive of selfish motive. It also implies that Hamm was complicit in this plan and the abuse of her children in order to maintain a relationship with LaGrone (8/10).

Some relatives of a woman convicted of allowing her three children to drown inside a car in a lake said they would seek mercy for her Thursday at her sentencing for child endangerment.

Other people, including the children's father, said they will ask that Amanda Hamm be given the maximum sentence in the deaths of Christopher Hamm, 6, Austin Brown, 3, and Kyleigh Hamm, 1, who were trapped inside a car that sank in Clinton Lake on Sept. 2, 2003.

Hamm, 30, was convicted in December but cleared of first-degree murder charges that would have sent her to prison for life. She faces up to 20 years in prison but also could be set free.

Hamm and then-boyfriend Maurice LaGrone Jr., who was convicted of first-degree murder in April, said the drownings were a tragic accident.

LaGrone, 31, who is serving a life sentence without a chance of parole, has appealed his conviction.

Prosecutors alleged LaGrone planned to kill the children because they were getting in the way of his sex-and-drugs lifestyle. Hamm went along with the plan as well as LaGrone's abuse of her and her children because she could not live without a man, prosecutors said.

Hamm and LaGrone have maintained the car accidentally rolled into about 4 1/2 feet of water as LaGrone tried to back up from a boat ramp where he had parked during a family outing.
