The article portrays the crime as harmful by mentioning the potential death of a young child (7/10). 

However, the malicious intent of the perpetrator is not as explicit. The article does mention her being indicted for first-degree murder, which implies premeditation, but it's stated in such a matter-of-fact way and there isn't much detail about her motives or specific intent (6/10).

The mother of a missing 3-year-old girl was arrested yesterday and charged with killing her daughter, even though the child's body has not been found during an exhaustive four-month search.

A grand jury indicted Casey Anthony on charges of first-degree murder, aggravated child abuse, aggravated manslaughter and four counts of lying to investigators about the disappearance of her daughter, Caylee, State Attorney Lawson Lamar said. The mother is being held without bond.

If convicted of first-degree murder, she could face the death penalty or life in prison. Prosecutors said no decision has been made if the death penalty will be sought.

Orange County Sheriff Kevin Beary said investigators would continue doing "everything in our power to find little Caylee."

A few hours before the sealed indictment was issued yesterday, the 22-year-old Anthony stood silently, sometimes crying, as her lawyer told reporters she is innocent.

After the indictment was announced, a spokesperson for Casey Anthony's lawyer said Lamar was rushing the case to the grand jury as a ploy to get re-elected.

Caylee's grandmother first called authorities in July to say she hadn't seen the child for a month and that her daughter Casey's car smelled like death.

Casey Anthony told authorities she had left her child with a sitter in June, and the two were gone when she returned from work. She says she spent the next month trying to find her daughter and didn't call authorities because she was scared.
