The harmfullness is emphasized indirectly through the mention of the victim being punched by both Brown and his bodyguard, as the act of not just one, but two individuals physically assaulting a third one, can be perceived as more harmful or violent than a one on one situation. (6/10)

The malicious intent is portrayed subtly. Brown's bodyguard justifying the assault by claiming the man tried to get on the bus, and the contrast of the victim's account of trying to get into a photo, create a hint of malice. However, it is relatively shallow in depth as it does not provide a clear motive or intensive focus on the perpetrator's perspective or intention. (4/10)

Singer Chris Brown's trial on an assault charge is scheduled to begin in Washington.

Brown's trial had been set for Monday but was postponed while lawyers tried to work out whether his bodyguard will testify. It's unclear if the trial will start Wednesday, as Brown's lawyers seem to want, or if further legal maneuvering will delay it.

Both Brown and his bodyguard were arrested in October. They are accused of punching a man outside a Washington hotel. Brown's bodyguard, Christopher Hollosy, told police that he punched the man after he tried to get on Brown's tour bus. But the man told police both men punched him after he tried to get in a photo Brown was taking with two women.

Hollosy was convicted of assault Monday in a separate trial.
