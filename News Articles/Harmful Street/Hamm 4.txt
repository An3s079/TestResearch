The article indicates quite a high level of harm caused by the crime, focusing on the fact that three young children were victims (8/10). 

The article shows a reasonable degree of malicious intent by stating that the crime was planned because the children were 'in the way' of the relationship between the two adults, suggesting a selfish motive. However, it's not entirely clear whether both parties were equally involved in the premeditation of this act. For this reason, we assign a slightly lower rank for maliciousness (7/10).

A mother helped plot the drowning deaths of her three children to preserve her relationship with the man who killed them, prosecutors said in closing arguments Wednesday in the woman's murder trial.

Prosecutor Roger Simpson said Amanda Hamm, 30, has low self-esteem and needed a man to ``validate her existence.''

Hamm faces life in prison if convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of her children, Christopher Hamm, 6, Austin Brown, 3, and Kyleigh Hamm, 23 months. The children died after Hamm's car sank at a Clinton Lake boat ramp on Sept. 2, 2003.

Prosecutors allege Hamm and then-boyfriend Maurice LaGrone Jr. planned the drownings because the children were in the way of their relationship. Hamm and LaGrone have maintained the deaths were a tragic accident that occurred after LaGrone parked the car too close to the water during a family outing.

LaGrone, 31, was convicted in April of first-degree murder in the children's deaths and is serving life in prison without parole.

Simpson said that LaGrone abused both Hamm and her children.

``Her man became her addiction,'' Simpson said. ``She could not give up her addiction to help herself, she could not give up her addiction to help her children.''
