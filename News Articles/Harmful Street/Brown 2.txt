The article details the assault and explains that the victim tried to join a picture, which resulted in the assault. However, there is not much emphasis on the impact of the assault on the victim, such as using words that indicate significant harm or distress. The harmfullness level is therefore relatively low (4/10).

The article clearly indicates that Chris Brown intentionally punched the man, but the crime seems more impulsive rather than premediated or caused by selfish motives such as wealth or revenge. Therefore, I rate the maliciousness at a moderate level (5/10).

Chris Brown has pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault in Washington, where he was accused of punching a man who tried to join a picture the singer was taking with two women outside a hotel.



Brown was sentenced to time served on Tuesday. He had been in jail for two days in the case.



He had been arrested and charged with misdemeanor assault in October after the scuffle outside the W hotel. The victim in the case says Brown hit him after he tried to get in a photograph Brown was taking with two women.



Brown had previously acknowledged to a judge in Los Angeles that he had violated probation by committing a crime in Washington. He had been on probation for a 2009 attack on the singer Rihanna, his girlfriend at the time.
