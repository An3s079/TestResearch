The article provides a fairly balanced view of the situation and isn't overly focused on the harm inflicted on the victim, it does mention the little girl's murder only a few times without graphic descriptions or emphasis on the harm done. Therefore, harmfullness is rated 6/10. 

The part of the article that addresses the potential maliciousness of the potential perpetrator(s) focuses on the case's developments and the accusations against a new suspect. However, it does not extensively delve into explanations of malicious intent or selfish motives. That's why maliciousness is rated 4/10.

DIANE SAWYER (ABC NEWS)​ (Off-camera) We move ahead now, and as we said, to new developments in the Casey Anthony murder case, the young woman accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter, Caylee. Her defense team says the real killer is still out there, and they think they might know who it is. And ABC's Andrea Canning has more on that. Andrea?

ANDREA CANNING (ABC NEWS)​ (Off-camera) Good morning, Diane. And the plot thickens in this case. The defense is going after the man who found Caylee's remains, meter reader, Roy Kronk, saying he should have been looked at more closely from the very beginning. Casey's attorneys interviewed Kronk's ex-wives and family members, and based on what they learned, they believe Kronk is quote, "equally as likely to be responsible for the death of the child."

REPORTER (FEMALE)​ Has it been tough on you?

ROY KRONK (FOUND CAYLEE'S REMAINS)​ I just don't prefer speaking to the media, to be honest with you. Yeah, it's been very tough on me.

ANDREA CANNING (ABC NEWS)​ (Voiceover) Former Florida utility worker, Roy Kronk, was hailed a good citizen by prosecutors when he discovered the remains of little Caylee Anthony nearly a year ago.

CLIP FROM 911 CALL

ROY KRONK (FOUND CAYLEE'S REMAINS)​ I'm in a wooded area down by the school. I, I need you, like, now. I just found a human skull.

ANDREA CANNING (ABC NEWS)​ (Voiceover) But today, it's Kronk who's under fire from Casey Anthony's defense team.

REPORTER (FEMALE)​ It sounds like they've been digging into Roy's past. Any concern about that?

DAVID EVANS (ROY KRONK'S ATTORNEY)​ I mean, they're doing what you would expect them to do, that is, they're trying to defend their client.

ANDREA CANNING (ABC NEWS)​ (Voiceover) In the motion, the defense asked the judge to allow new witness interviews into evidence meant to raise suspicion about Kronk. Ex-wife, Jill Kerley, claims he beat her in 1992.

JILL KERLEY (KRONK'S EX-WIFE)​ He duct taped my hands one time. And he told me if I move that he would beat me. He would know if I moved.

ANDREA CANNING (ABC NEWS)​ (Voiceover) Anthony's attorney says the allegation Kronk used duct tape for the purposes of restraining women is significant, because duct tape was used in Caylee's murder. Another ex-wife from 1982, Crystal Sparks, says Kronk is not to be believed.

CRYSTAL SPARKS (KRONK'S EX-WIFE)​ Roy talks so many untruths that you can't, when he does talk the truth, you can't, you just can't believe it.

ANDREA CANNING (ABC NEWS)​ (Voiceover) Kronk's attorney says his client strongly denies all of the allegations in the motion and in the witness interviews.

DAVID EVANS (ROY KRONK'S ATTORNEY)​ They're just asking their questions. We'll, you know, we don't wanna comment in the middle of a deposition.

ANDREA CANNING (ABC NEWS)​ (Voiceover) Last year, Kronk was persistent, calling the sheriff's office several times over the course of four months before finally finding Caylee's remains in December. In a January interview on "GMA," he spoke about the pressure of being the one to make that discovery.

ROY KRONK (FOUND CAYLEE'S REMAINS)​ And you try to do the right thing, you try to be a nice guy, and you just get vilified. And I have nothing to do with this at all.

ANDREA CANNING (ABC NEWS)​ (Voiceover) Meanwhile, the prosecution says it has plenty of evidence against Casey Anthony. This FBI email revealed there was a stain found in the trunk of her car that could be in the shape of a child. Tests also showed signs of human decomposition in her trunk. And then, there's Casey's alleged string of lies.

ANDREA CANNING (ABC NEWS)​ (Off-camera) We reached out to the Orange County Prosecutor's Office. They had no comment. But in the days following Kronk's discovery, they said he did the right thing.

DIANE SAWYER (ABC NEWS)​ (Off-camera) Okay, Andrea. Thanks so much to you. And now, we are going to pipe ourselves back aboard that giant ship with Sam Champion in Florida. Sam?
